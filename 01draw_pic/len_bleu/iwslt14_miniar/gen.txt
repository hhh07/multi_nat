hey , why not ?
good work ! yes !
that &apos;s super important .
the farm is incredible .
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s going on .
so what do you say ?
robert gupta .
what happened here ?
thank you very much .
sounds familiar , what ?
why no longer life ?
they have similar principles .
oh , that &apos;s one .
1,000 , very good .
this is our present .
that &apos;s the system .
you could see manhattan .
that was the result .
there &apos;s no normal one .
centers were built .
just do your job .
i &apos;m interested in that .
what happened here ?
lento , slowly .
yes , good day .
yes , good day .
very different term .
stand them .
what a fish .
in fact , that &apos;s me .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
wonderful , so ?
and she did .
they &apos;re all important .
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s efficient .
not very sustainable .
it &apos;s essential .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
what did they do ?
ban is blank .
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
pretty good , right ?
a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he opens the door .
so they knew everything .
not guilt management .
how do we know ?
and i was an artist .
because you know what ?
yes , that &apos;s going .
we can do it differently .
so how does this work ?
let &apos;s call him don .
how are you interested in ?
what do these people need ?
can we change it ?
these days are over .
bg : thank you .
can i be honest ?
this is the last one .
you can go in .
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
that would have been okay .
i was thinking about it .
what is media today ?
so let &apos;s see .
here &apos;s an example .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re dragging . &quot;
i faced with him .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
and that &apos;s important .
but you know what ?
it has sensors .
we can do that .
what was the result ?
here &apos;s the video .
yes , milliseconds .
but you know what ?
rate it again .
that &apos;s very good .
all the environmental debate .
these people make money .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , i know .
i have a question .
i don &apos;t think so .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
that &apos;s a wish .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
flying cat flying cat .
why do we do that ?
they use their hands .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s terrible .
oh my god !
we lose them .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
we love entertainment .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s going .
does that sound good ?
a lot .
we &apos;re going to take off .
i can help .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
the only chance .
that was incredible .
long , yeah .
stephen watts .
the sun rises .
fantastic , right ?
yeah , in a way .
thank you .
no hospital either .
where ?
they need time .
we were poor .
thank you .
and he says ...
are all these ?
that &apos;s going fast .
that &apos;s not ...
one and a half million .
that &apos;s hard to do .
what does that mean ?
yeah . okay .
i &apos;m tom .
here it is .
that &apos;s us .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
music as a language .
from seattle ...
yes , hello .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s singing .
what does that mean ?
solar technology is ...
a few less .
we know that .
that &apos;s wrong .
we love innovation .
keep twice .
after a week .
it &apos;s interesting .
ta-da !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
woa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
come on .
60,000 .
pretty simple .
suck .
sustainable .
unique .
fine .
thank you .
thank you .
positive .
thank you .
it alone about that alone .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
one ?
can you do that ?
well , yeah .
that &apos;s true .
seriously .
that &apos;s going .
maybe not .
ol√© !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah .
yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
yeah !
thank you .
yes ?
why ?
okay .
yeah .
really .
yes ?
here &apos;s what .
yeah .
yes ?
okay .
creativity .
yes ?
no .
thank you .
yes ?
fantastic .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
yes ?
yes ?
wow !
it &apos;s about that .
thank you .
yes ?
thank you .
hello !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yes ?
my wife told me .
let &apos;s honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
again , here you have it again .
so what &apos;s what &apos;s hack now ?
and finally , epic significance .
this picture is from this place .
that was the beginning of the journey .
first extension , second .
you want to feed the world ?
she connected these two people .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
but it was very sad .
what is this thing ?
they could have done better .
and that &apos;s the crux .
but they do the job .
that &apos;s very risky .
does it make that curious ?
and how did that feel ?
and that worked very well .
so it works like this .
very frightening .
they both called me .
overlived technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming in .
the orange tractor .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is , ...
what about fitness ?
the power plant can explode .
and then they set them up .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
what happened there ?
the one place is south korea .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
you really loved it .
same thing , just bigger .
well , i was the next one .
is that reasonable ?
i just loved two .
she &apos;s sharing their experience with others .
well , let &apos;s want .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it was a huge success .
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
the data was not available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
pattern recognition should work .
it was my first sunburn .
and there are hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
you can have that cloud .
it &apos;s not our burden .
because you can train that .
think about your own decisions .
so it &apos;s circle .
i wanted to support them .
sometimes i push too much .
and then everybody went down .
i had awe .
her mother raised her on her own .
it &apos;s kind of like that , you know .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
tell me about this world .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
that &apos;s such a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this is what happened at christmas .
okay , there are a few .
they saw the big deal .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plush .
who are these relatives ?
i want to ask you something .
we need to spread the message .
you can see that down there .
you also have to understand that .
why not think about it that way ?
what do i look at ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
his name is tempt .
but what do we do with it ?
you can see the water coming .
first of all , we have the population .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
... invent his own story .
is it about light ?
now , what does that mean ?
i was devastated .
this is pre-visual .
so what do you think happened now ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i had a good life .
the game is from 2007 .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
we &apos;re no longer producing ourselves .
i can claim everything .
what &apos;s the soul ?
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll end up now .
you can &apos;t have bones .
it may sound miserable .
we were 20 people .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
that &apos;s how many .
will it be my size ?
or is it possible ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
conflicts creativity emerges .
this is felix .
so what do we need to do ?
it would be knowledless .
and this opens up a map .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
most of you here know .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re constantly hitting each time .
that &apos;s kind of it .
there are online criminals .
i created one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no food .
people were playing insane .
but it gets worse .
it keeps you fresh .
he really liked it .
does anybody see something particular ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
good afternoon , all together .
and then it became international .
let me wrap up .
there &apos;s an old study .
and so it was like that .
he used to point out here .
that &apos;s a great question .
some people have come and left .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were remixes .
this is the city .
in china , it was different .
here &apos;s another example .
i agree with you completely .
dk : 60,000 .
luckily not , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
first of all , limited .
thank you .
why should we do that ?
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
i wonder .
thank you very much for listening .
they even hurt .
i swear it up .
i represent kids .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s against justice .
jk : both .
but what do your fish eat ?
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
place the camera out .
again , my gut feeling again .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
after just one journey there .
yeah . all right .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
here you see it .
it &apos;s a tremendous challenge .
the data came in .
what creates the illusion ?
don &apos;t be discouraged .
i don &apos;t think so much .
what would everything have to be done ?
it was still fish .
and a lot of people forget this .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
am i going to like the color ?
my name is amit .
privacy must be given .
ooh , thank you .
is that your opinion ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
they look like this .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is the short-term capture .
the work of interpreting .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
i think it &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we useful ?
so , what does that mean ?
let &apos;s also call him don well .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we actually work ?
i think it &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened years after that ?
i grew up in india .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
is it even photography ?
okay , a few more .
i mean the soul .
but there &apos;s something else .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
very expensive real estate .
yes , here it is .
and the answer to that is no .
and it got better .
just going on . it &apos;s great .
ohh .
crisis . death . disaster .
did you see these guys ?
i felt really good .
we have three main groups .
give pee a chance .
and i &apos;ve always had that .
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
you order comparison .
and why is that ?
he &apos;d had the experience .
it would be intolerable .
we &apos;ve lost contact .
that was what she did secretly .
okay . thank you very much .
this is what happens to us today .
so she was back .
oh . wait .
what do you want to do ?
i want to tell you .
or before bombs .
we need energy miracles .
why is this happening at all ?
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two options .
but i continued to work .
not toxic in there .
you see it immediately .
and i continued to work .
what about longevity ?
the game begins -- silence .
do you want to make suck jeans ?
it &apos;s like talking .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
so i just started playing .
this is not how you can do something out of nothing .
but it &apos;s not documented .
so you can &apos;t solve it at all .
and this video is real time .
i like things that are different .
and that &apos;s at the beginning .
it really changed the dynamic .
i went to jail -- hard .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
they sell certificates .
the truth is more like this .
because for me , it means memory .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them before .
and then we said , okay .
it spreads rapidly .
how and what did he feel ?
it can know where we are .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
we say sustainability in germany .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
this is a picture of the object .
do you know what &apos;s envy ?
but we need it all .
that sounds frightening .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is frightening .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next : nuclear energy .
let &apos;s keep that quiet .
but fully effective , right ?
it &apos;s completely trivial .
thank you very much for your patience .
what else &apos;s risky ?
now , i was trying something exciting .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
her family gathered .
i remember my first fire .
i fell in love with this fish .
dark urine . dark .
nullemissions , right ?
what is a story like ?
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
the motivations to write it .
i shoot something through my head .
so , look what happens .
anyway , not to navigate .
why did i go to medicine ?
otherwise , they can &apos;t have teeth .
all adults were aware of the risks .
have you ever been discriminate ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
so the correlation is low .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
it turns out to be really hard to do .
how far do you get there ?
and these are the neural structures .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
anyway , we need a solution .
if you get to that , right ?
you can do it all the time .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
so we measured his movement .
and that can make a lot of difference .
but the truth is far from that .
it seemed to be quite popular .
on the book and on the picture .
you can see something fun here .
that &apos;s what i stop , thank you very much .
that &apos;s just the minimum right now .
that doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
they flooded the channels .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
five million people use it every month .
but it requires a lot of planning .
it makes leukemia in kids .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
okay , you really want to know that ?
now i see greg lemoon .
we can regain our nutrients .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
that has to be the difference of aging .
i &apos;m not taking the same line .
you can show , i was there .
they haven &apos;t given up government .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s deceptive .
do we really want to go that way ?
they had been genetically expressed .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
he can only use his eyes .
they &apos;re going to be irresistible .
so the first step to an interpretation .
in adopting maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
lego made it possible for everyone .
and there are several reasons for this .
i really like beautiful clothes .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because we live on a water planet .
privacy is not the debate .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
this picture reminded me of something .
baseball is full of great statistics .
oh , my time is already over ?
something went up inside of me .
i could draw . i could paint .
i really wanted to work normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
we can &apos;t just do that .
once the judge saw me .
so i went to the court .
i got some scared of technology .
they create an epic story .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and there &apos;s good news .
my name is brian goldman .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the story is not over yet .
but there are two problems with this .
and it was an incredible experience .
so it &apos;s not like detox .
no one has ever said that before .
the whole building was made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
what should our testimony look like ?
but , but you know what ?
they can play with different ways .
is this all just education ?
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
they basically do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other brands are like this ?
the white lines are for the population .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child &apos;s games .
and that &apos;s what we did .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
and then something weird happened .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible aties .
they have so much uncertainty .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
that was great .
the data is showing this all the time .
for example , this perception in the context .
that made me really sad .
they always say , why ?
what happened that day ?
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
people were still happy .
so let me remind you .
they come from the artists .
she was back and she was dying .
now , how did this happen ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
but that &apos;s not going to go that fast .
this is a game for outside .
i learned everything memorized .
does anybody know what that is ?
he also showed him jafour .
and we take it all up .
so that &apos;s the good news .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so they saw something magical .
play is not silly .
and i said , &quot; of course .
he actually collected fish .
no had never been an opportunity .
so , we can .
how can we help you ? &quot;
further than that we don &apos;t go .
once we started a vivid .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
they become the computer in the open computer .
because does anybody have masses here ?
every waste is nutrients .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re too many .
this one has the greatest impact .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and the shape plays a role .
slowly but safe it turned to be .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and then i can transmit the whole thing .
what lessons have we learned ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
and it starts with a doctor .
they &apos;re getting more and more like them .
i &apos;m going to tell you something to you .
because i can say anything .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
i asked the nurse on a lot of time .
creativity had to look out somehow .
today , everything &apos;s easy to have .
an autistic student .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
take nothing but granted .
and that was 19 years ago .
doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
italy winning . yeah .
but i &apos;m not buying anything new .
let &apos;s be othuck . &quot;
it &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
so paul is a terrorist .
which one would you like most ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
i never cook with it .
the morning before the game .
i started to feel better .
they &apos;re all important possibilities . &quot;
so this is one of the images .
we went to an area .
and here &apos;s the representation .
we depend on two countries .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
it just doesn &apos;t work technological .
he pointed at the algae .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and then realizing it .
below that , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
and you already have a problem .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
so the question is : how ?
so men can &apos;t be pigs with that .
look at what she does .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe in that .
but with the right design , there we go .
how would you describe your brand ?
we can support them to be good .
something very strange is happening here .
i &apos;m a speaker person .
what are these three billion people bring along ?
we also got very accurate data .
it was really , really profound .
they &apos;re all picking questions .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live in .
we can support them to be good .
and women argued it succeed .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
you should want some .
even cats are looking at this video .
the roof was also covered with water .
this is a painting of a circle .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
but i continued to ask these questions .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
you can see away from the back to the front of the first time .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
he moved back to silence .
especially if he &apos;s already died .
it &apos;s been defeated constant so far .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so scott gets this fruit .
politely , everybody applaud .
now look at this curve .
so i followed my gut feeling .
they &apos;ve literally laid down the lever .
maybe put some mutations .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
adversity are just part of our lives .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked till late at night .
they have them . they always have them .
the byproduct is clean water .
we need to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
it turns off the power plants .
it might take a while to be invited .
i &apos;m going to read you the entry .
there was jimmy kimmy kimdrum .
so from modern society to computer society .
and the curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
we talk ambiguous about it .
we go through initiation rituals .
it &apos;s about resupply of america .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the mechanism is from the lie .
the main man would wave me up .
a dalmatiner , right .
no , that was what i thought .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
and also , these sources are interruptions .
no , no , it &apos;s missing .
the chef had cooked it .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is such a commissioned part .
the shore is from another place .
we now have masses in this country .
they can be logical and intuitive .
i lived in parallel worlds .
and that was the outbreak of thing .
so the first excitute primate .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
maybe i did it with good reason .
not even the truth will free it .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
maybe we need to take a look beyond that .
these kinds of states don &apos;t exist for us .
we can give ourselves something like this .
156 nations are sending our television channel .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
we live in a really extraordinary time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and even lomborg thinks about .
the dose also plays a role .
everybody &apos;d like to make people happier .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
to say , what &apos;s information ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things .
you put a box like this .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
we talk about audacious , fresh .
he was shaking his head , no .
i thought everyone could do that .
but today we &apos;re way beyond that .
they tap on their internet connection .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
this is going to take place in the next april .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
they &apos;re the homecountries of someone .
what takes five thousand seconds to take ?
i see the dalmatiner .
so that &apos;s the reason this project .
tempt today is completely paralyzed today .
so ... so doesn &apos;t mean so optimistic .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
this is an ecological network .
does anybody even know what that is ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , what &apos;s going to work ?
and i &apos;d like to read those to you .
and there are collaborators .
make it possible -- all of you here .
that &apos;s just been represented .
so there &apos;s feedback .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and why ? it genetically changed food .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
so littlebit is open source .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
so this is a tough nt .
tell what you feel .
it &apos;s completely focused on a particular goal .
he died , broken through the story .
this is how the building works .
you always lose rare animals .
they interrupted each other .
it will touch her deeply .
they kept us being inspired .
i represent people into death cells .
that i &apos;d written these crazy things .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
let &apos;s start perceiving .
now we saw the reverse effect .
so there are two cycles coming out .
we &apos;ve embedded unique elements here .
this sounds , basically the first time unusual .
i hope you forgive me .
are you doing that for the kids ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
the rocks are color coded .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
a billion people are going to starve today .
no , no , it &apos;s not going to work .
i learned this from my grandmother .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
these rivers are taking very rapidly .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
and what does that mean for designers ?
i &apos;m going to shoot my sleeve back .
it &apos;s about inhale .
our magazines are read by millions .
it &apos;s about changing adaptive values .
a has these benefits and risks .
we need to think about what brands .
my brother staring at me .
who do you actually want to inform with this ?
we can reinvent everything again .
bjstockn sundin .
it &apos;s going to come very simple , that &apos;s going to come .
risk is not a simple game .
and that &apos;s how confused me like this ...
they even bring in funding .
and then a lot in the third , they forgotten again .
here &apos;s the olive oil aiss .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but then they really want to go deep inside .
the defeat would have been too simple .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
here he &apos;s going to let the sun go up .
who would ever wish one ?
and i jump on it every morning .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
he was sixty already .
that was more for emphasis .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
it was a pretty fateful project .
this is the storage basins .
and this sounds very different than it did before .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
no , i mean it really serious .
and the goal here is quite simple .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
and i had to go out of the city .
here &apos;s your brand aisle .
her father died shortly after her birth .
i started with my usual talk .
they want to orient in the museum ?
so this crazy story could be true .
we won a few awards .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i hold the knife in my hand .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
happy productivity . fantastic !
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of balance .
and that nobody seems to get above that .
in the people about the urine .
the living bears are the spirits .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
what words would you describe ban ?
the other one was a strong diarrhea .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
there are also world records as well .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
they add up very well .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
i could think of energy .
and that &apos;s where you feel it already .
students are divided to notes .
these things are logically correct .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
he &apos;s interested in fire .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate .
these are the apsaras .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
who could have looked like this ?
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
oh my god . oh my god .
we &apos;ve got a lot of procedures already .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
and it &apos;s dependent on phosphorus .
that &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i started an institute to do that .
so that &apos;s how nature are presented .
this may be transmitted publicly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i call this the bright tiger .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
longer than those other two networks .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
these are called project carrier today .
the movie hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
automatically , it walks the right thought .
as we think from north .
they gave their blood pressure increass .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i work in the solar technology industry .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
now , if you think a little bit further .
my parents are the 80 , on the heels .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
and let me show you a simple example .
if not , jellyfish today .
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re originally .
you &apos;re just listening , and then they start talking .
and the two latest ones are here today .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
but reality is always unpredictable .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
i remember it was yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
the official dogma of what ?
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
we &apos;re talking about drowning into information .
i tried to preserve the body .
we forced them . puff them .
it captures trash a thousand square kilometers .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
well , i walked into the courthouse .
i said , &quot; ok , granny . &quot;
because that &apos;s evidence with it , right ?
they laughed more than you do here .
you can come in for a particular year .
we reject genetically engineered food .
the three words are , do you remember ?
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
let me show you how they work .
you can zoom in and out very easily .
maybe we can see adversity as change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
just think of that for a moment .
you just have to spread it as much as you can .
we &apos;re now thinking about energy scarcity .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
so , this really blew my mind .
now can you play them in blue as well ?
people suffered . people were fighting .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
that &apos;s more like the norm to do it .
no , we find what &apos;s inside there .
raise your hands . let me see .
what ? that really let me freak out .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
you go around and you amuse .
restore america . find more out more .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
and there &apos;s a central point here .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but it has an unexpected twist .
shtz the environment , uses less energy .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
three : escalation of expectations .
you can jump right to one particular copy .
now you see the dalmatiner .
my fourth technology : requirement for complexity .
i thought i could integrate myself .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so again , this was fit really well .
and if you don &apos;t , yet you dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
anyway , they do it in there .
so that made sense , it fit together .
you &apos;re hoping we don &apos;t need that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and this is a million company .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
then he whispered me to the ear .
motors , gears -- four options .
and this is very important in medical research .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
eeee ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
yet , we seem to be all satisfied with it .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
there can be a sequence of changes .
we need to use more research funds .
and here &apos;s each piece is very well planned .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
let me show you close to it .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
this has got to go down , down to zero .
this is alfred gonzalez .
and in time , you can react to other things again .
shame . shame .
is it all about the details or the colors ?
the permanent ice is marked with red .
and there &apos;s the campiting problem .
it was something we knew to do .
this is called the osi.
but so many people got help over the years .
the third technizing : categorization .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
their problem is they have too little .
now i &apos;m adding a brel to it .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but i didn &apos;t let myself discourage of that .
intersexuality occurs in many different forms .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
no one has to give green light to their ideas .
he said , &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot;
i think i may have heard more hands .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is like .
scott was talking from man to human .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
our goal was just to say it , okay .
seriously -- it &apos;s refused to the mise !
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
we went out of what didn &apos;t work .
so get rid of it ; save the shoes .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
what do you do with certificates ?
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go another slide again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
so , that was my primary motivation .
by now , the instruments have moved .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
i &apos;m the smuseum guy .
do you remember the windmill ?
monday : color is something more powerful .
and then it usually looks like this usually .
imagine mozart efficient .
my mother called me for a few minutes after that .
they make sure that we get worse to there .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
so , help me do that .
i &apos;m very excited to be there .
if you burn coal , no .
we were asking around , and nobody knew .
the amounts of water have expanded .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
now , what are archaical models now ?
if you burn natural gas , no .
everybody &apos;s already eaten a cake already .
second half time . the end of the normal game time .
say there are no predictable .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
they know , science is not a company .
it kind of wired us .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
bad ? i was completely confused .
itself , damaged and without support .
what does this look like ? it &apos;s pretty good .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
that &apos;s what we get about an absolutely flat line about that .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
what you need is a new medical culture .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
and then what do you do with the garbage ?
there are a lot that needs to come together .
it was a grouper .
my cousins was walking all around .
this is an annual flow of diving water .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
they run the process , they understand it .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
i think our identity is threatened .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
the next step happened now within these communities .
they grow five inches .
it &apos;s all comes out of our own pockets .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
it can know how to keep it .
it &apos;s called &quot; sprinch with me . &quot;
there &apos;s never been a time like this before .
this is a humble little app .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
thank you , danny kahman .
it &apos;s personal impressions of the seerosis .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
because now you can apply a three sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
many of my clients are very young .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
eat a whole dish cool whip .
and then it can walk off right now .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
that &apos;s what he has to process that as a present .
i &apos;m going to try this through an example .
you can see the timeline up there .
here are two different jewelry facilities .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
this is one , part of it .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
this , by the way , is just the labor title .
so , it &apos;s here . right there .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what kind of actions do i appeal ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
isn &apos;t enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
you can predict that . why is that going ?
so what can we end from all of this ?
it &apos;s great for this number to go up .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so virtually , a translation of translation .
and on , now you always see him .
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputer .
the emergency person pulled all the strands .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about this topic .
no insurance can make a cross-way .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
in that three sentence , three sentences are happening .
three paragraph still know from school .
i want to explain that a little bit about a little bit .
in fact , bear didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you .
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of magnificent music .
shy the environment , make less waste .
this is just an insurance method .
a language is expression of the human mind .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
now let &apos;s get out something else out .
i get tired , like all of us .
but the game is a shapeer .
and anyway , italy ended up getting .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
again , it should contain the two elements again .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to me .
yes . it does nothing but discovering .
thank you . i have a question for you .
this is roberto dance .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;ll talk about that .
but western governments also help themselves .
and ecologically , it was a catastrophe .
that really solves the fuel problem .
this is my supermarket . this is not a big one .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
he &apos;d uploaded a lot of natural videos .
in other areas , the world of communication .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
one thing i thought he had nearest stones .
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the label .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones as well .
the silence is earthetizing .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
as i said , amanda is wearing our elegs .
both of them are survivable , both of them .
but maybe you can still vote them .
i remember as if it was yesterday .
all of this are summarized , errors are inevitable .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of preventing animals often .
there were no cantaloupei melons .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
so that they can understand all the movement .
they get less than we catch them .
there seems to be a disagreement .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so here &apos;s another people who test it .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
and we see that it &apos;s going through .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
the flamgos eat the shrimp .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
that &apos;s sort of like our combat .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and i becomes a character in the book .
what about life longer in good health ?
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
and the memory was playing in that head was happening .
and what does it actually look inside there ?
and that &apos;s what i found was incredibly exciting .
we understood that the weather is global .
you seem apparently seen it in the news .
so , we can &apos;t take these things at all .
it has over 300 million molecular weight of molecular weight .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern of development .
i have something here that i want to show you .
in the countries where people come to money .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store them off , delete the rest of it .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
have you all taken your vitamins this morning ?
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
no apple has ever tasted that again .
the writing of dna was an interesting step .
so that was a very strange experience .
and giving back to my upper doctor .
all over the place these wind are around , almost .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel us real money .
and finally , let &apos;s welcome transparency .
she had the last word in every family argument .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
how could it be possible that we did that ?
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
it &apos;s sort of like a behavior poop print .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard thing to do diagnosis .
i was an obsessive student .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
because actually , this human being is not interested in proof proof at all .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he &apos;s only fooling you and not himself .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
... that the doses also play a role .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s repair that .
today , i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
the marshmallow has to be on top of the top .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
this is footage of a six-second duration .
and you say , what happens to these moments ?
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
or they didn &apos;t have photoolitography .
well , really good , maybe a single star .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
here are the results that we just got .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
i think the curiosity is the curiosity at first .
i did my job at 95 kilograms .
that drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
but how do you do that in practice ?
so each droplet was a little bit different .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
not everything to be composable , of course .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like that .
this is a dead turtle .
there are those that are much more spatial .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
what we found is that it &apos;s moving really strange .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
yeah , so , what should biohacking be ?
good night , sweet thylum . &quot;
you see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
there &apos;s hardly spoken spoken spoken about interpretation .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
and that worked . scott applause for scott .
and all of this leads to us to the one big question .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
anyway . i certainly want to do that .
there are as well as technical cycle .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
and every night they fly back 240 miles .
that &apos;s where every footprint is disadvantaged .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
the question is , why do people accept that ?
and they had to remove what we did .
now i &apos;m going to choose the government issue .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
ladies and gentlemen , your relationships .
so i think we need to be leaders .
they &apos;re living with chemosynthesis .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
first of all , we &apos;ve only signed up .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
it &apos;s linked by oxygen and silicon .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
she &apos;s got a button , on / off .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s pretend here we have a machine here .
these things have a more positive effect .
there &apos;s somebody there who didn &apos;t have childhood in the back there .
what &apos;s the food processing ? &quot;
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer is going to be like ?
for the rest of the time , they &apos;re dolphoczed .
no wanted to have something to do with the movie .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
every morning , they fly two miles to the farm .
all of it is composable of this .
now i &apos;d usually take out the needle now .
so you can &apos;t put them together the wrong .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
what we want is to create the future .
this is compared in china in a second .
my grandparents put that number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
the first one is a classic , apple .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
now they &apos;re all back on their way back .
picasso answers , just wait .
so two couples , each one grows a baby .
and we &apos;re constantly increasing our expectations .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
that the ecology is a global issue .
storytelling uses more and more senses .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;m going to do some more drums about this .
i was so science enthusiastic , you know .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
this is going to be a key element of this testimony .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
no one &apos;s done like this in the world has done that yet .
today , a lot of people have given up government .
next week , this is coming to the market .
natural light then offers smart-grid .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
there are some very interesting developments .
we want something about the death penalty .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
so smart-grid , a huge topic everywhere .
so summarized the last three of the five .
so each concert is a different concert .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
and we need to make a lot of this device .
it came out four and a half years ago in italy .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet retaines a realistic level .
and everything is packaging or content .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
so not saving , avoid consuming , avoid avoiding .
that would roll over the country to them .
there &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer this for nine .
he came up to me and hugged me .
i &apos;m so sorry . is she doing it crazy ?
everyone who was like started to divide up .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you for a moment .
it was a lot off , and i was in hurry .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern is trying to see something .
we &apos;re not invent identity , we invent them .
so she &apos;s supposed to get from the outside to people .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
at the beginning , the tribal society through language .
i highlighted it especially here .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
and then , of course , it was click then .
and i have to say , there was power .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
i &apos;m going to start with a few simple examples .
but the best part is coming -- in a second .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i want to show you something here very first of all here .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i never want to move anything in my life .
do you know what &apos;s called a 4,00ter ?
it supports when others talk about their mistakes .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
what happened is that we could do that .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i set up .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fingers go down .
so i was talking at a conference a few months later .
for example , of the sneaker , right ?
i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
and that argument makes no sense .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
they don &apos;t invest time in power fights .
notice two things at this curve .
so in the theme of the day , financial saving .
and we want to make this material available to all .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i took a while to figure that out .
think about it . this attack is generic .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces of puzzle .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
and if you don &apos;t , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
and we designed an ipad app .
this is another look at the tree of life .
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country .
look , let me give you an analogy .
they moved to a naturalistic concept .
and then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
i think that &apos;s true of every human on the planet .
child mortality has declined by one tenth of child .
loans and sponsors were searched .
there are no overpopulation problems of trees .
so these women met and they just talked .
each big picture is the beginning of a snippets .
so he got the citizens to check them .
imagine a soundless airplane .
he says , &quot; make pare to the impact . &quot;
so we &apos;re starting with a windows dropcker .
and the third area , which is actually explaining itself .
they divided the kingdom into two tanks .
&quot; look at your bellies , pink .
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
you zoomed in it . you can actually go into it .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
but what this picture is a problem .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .

i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website here .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down attribute ?
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke at all , but was joke .
do that once , and then experience the sentence .
we can continue these things in different examples .
what we stayed with is storytelling .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and the world we lived looked like this .

i had a relationship to this beauty for several months .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .

from the avian age to the machine age .
well , let me show you a little bit more of that .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .

we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a lot of loss .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
and so i made a little bit unusual decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
we see the same thing with the disabled movement .
we want to eliminate mass incarrocations . &quot;
there &apos;s a connection , each other &apos;s respect .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor into the scene .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
because we can &apos;t live without that livestock .

wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
this is just online -- no press , no television .

but letting them down is not always that bad thing .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
i &apos;m probably many of you in the room probably know this trick .
you know , i had this idea of a movie .
why do i have to afford &quot; little car ?

you can say things here that are influence worldwide .
... could you just show the slide for a moment .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and that &apos;s what we learn and the rules of the game .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?

i thought let &apos;s take the use of labor in the same .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so we walk away before , and where do we walk ?

i first agree , that &apos;s logical .
the underwater part is from a quarry .
the people in the side rooms are now coming in .

the dog ! i was linguistic to envy .
it seems important to unite both .
and what was that for you ? what was it successful ?
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .

because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
well , because they don &apos;t know it used to be different .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for none of our big problems .
restore america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .

but we don &apos;t know a little bit about where things are going .
it &apos;s the way it happened in the village earlier .
i know what people think when they see that .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
in other words , play is our adaptation joker .

and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
and then they &apos;ve then ordered a whole bunch of simulations .

so i know some of you who haven &apos;t entered .
i filmed in warfare areas -- difficult and dangerous .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?

it &apos;s this shining cook taste .
we can actually do the same things that we do with less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .

well , the energy source has fallen over time .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?

in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
they get a model that comes out of all over the world .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and these interactive portraits realize each other .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we returned to the wreck of the titanic .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
the living self has no voice in that choice .

because artists have a disrupted ratio to lie .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressivity .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?

it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
both cases naked up to me , ask me up .
that &apos;s why just thinking from the weigh to the weigh .
we just alert there the way we did .

i &apos;m going to play what these notes might mean .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
again , what potential do we want to call out now ?

and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
so , if you could put the light on again .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
this is what happened . it wasn &apos;t a team had a stable structure .
so the device you see didn &apos;t work .

they add a blue one to a green one , and they can make light .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived you .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
and what we found was that there was actually a context .
we think about our future as an precautionary memories .
because music is a language and it &apos;s a language for communicating there .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
so they move around , and they make art installations like these .
that &apos;s why they help with it , ask people what people once .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
a typical wal-mart now offers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
which would you like to have if it could only have one ?
but also our perception itself , how do it fake us ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
how many doors does the house you live in ?
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
but so far , i &apos;m going to get it a little bit curious yet .
i was shocked , and i was cracked into the inside .
and then we started negotiating with the insulers .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something we do .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
i went home through the emergency department on my way .
depends of a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
when we looked at how income emotions variate emotions .
and i appreciate many of you have done that too .
that &apos;s all of them in the pre-winding phase .
this is what i want to present to you to two , maybe three examples as well .
very rarely you actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who , by the way , hits four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve used to things happening linear .
i had a 14-year-old black boy as a clients .
and then people could eat it , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
in there they &apos;re in , they want to go up to the end of the gangs .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it cleans up the water .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that already . thank you very much .
and then i come in immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sell . &quot;
secondly , combined photos should have the same kind of lighting .
and also , what you would think about today in the mind today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and we can replace the oil with other energy from other energy reducers .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . hearulations .
but can you do , if you &apos;re into foreign one .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
it &apos;s just that i think he &apos;s more likely to like it , right ?
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
i mentioned this across miguel , and he was nodding .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through masses , 20 an hour .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
but it turns out that &apos;s not all it yet .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts on taste .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
so there should be a nine to be at the beginning of my death number .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not doing it .
for example , would this somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
you have to admit that &apos;s a huge selection .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
we &apos;ve also brought littlittliits to design schools .
let &apos;s call the animal vessel , it costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
why are they advertising us if we can &apos;t buy ?
this is an idiotic debate . she has to stop .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prefer against injustice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing the legal area .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
that all of our survival is linked to survival every single person survival .
well , i sometimes play with them sometimes , but not very often .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-cellular community .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
this is the time period of time you fall in love .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
if one neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
i mean , how much do we drive from our memories ?
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
they come to thabo mbeki in south africa .
and because we &apos;re going to grow older , the wind will get bigger .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing going on the movie of stats .
i just want to tell a little bit about salatdressing .
players are masters in the denser of the denser of social nets .
so that really turned me , and i wanted more .
yes , this is what one &apos;s down there &apos;s just the load down there .
for example , the invention of language , was a little step in that direction .
depending on its behavior , we can predict structure and function .
there are many more people , but i lacking time .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but it &apos;s efficiency .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
a few months ago went over , and i &apos;d just forgotten everything .
and immediately , i see another pattern that comes out .
each of these themes , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared in human anymore .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
we &apos;ve been using ourselves now in holland over three years .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so it turned out of the same , bad team of one of the best .
and of course , in germany , it can never be there anymore . &quot;
a consequence of that was that the phone had never broken .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s part of it .
an amazing error rate . one in nine is innocent .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more force .
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
now , where are we supposed to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
i studied woman printer , and she was in respiratory .
so the painter the belly the better the system . &quot;
the more money you make , the more happy you are .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
and they were lifted the way through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
we &apos;ve moved before in what &apos;s called the avian age before .
well , your living self is not going to be happier .
this is the publication that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat beat 300 .
since that time , we &apos;ve been getting all sorts of recognition .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
in 2010 , we &apos;d just connected under two billion people online with each other online .
i have a friend , he &apos;s driving a passenger ati .
so there &apos;s no excuse to someone in this audience .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
i can say the canger is a man .
i know now it was the reason of the ocean .
he &apos;s got a foraging from 15 to one foraging .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
it was completely excluded that she could fail at that .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
they interact with their environment and their experience clearly .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
you can do this trick to your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
they were afraid of pirate , rape and death .
the death penalty in america defines by error .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes hasn &apos;t changed very much .
56 percent of all rapes don &apos;t get on trial .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we rushed his bed so he can look outside .
just this airport has a area of 100 square kilometers .
we put games in order to escape the suffering of the real world .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all of these extensions .
this goes much further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
our gut is a wonderfully host environment for these bacteria .
about that time , an anecdote talks that you might know .
i couldn &apos;t have done it any better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-cleaning .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to the scientific assignment .
someone had collapsed , and they &apos;d been hacked the system .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
but a lot of people are trapped in a very strange position .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good medial opportunity .
this actually didn &apos;t just took two thousand eight shape , these networks .
it &apos;s no longer necessary to whistle or sing a song .
so in my opinion , it &apos;s a very charged hack .
i brought seven some underwear with me , and that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landroad .
now , i wondered , how can i really bring this over ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert like this .
i think somehow such a six dollars or something like that .
turned the garbage ton on the side . went home .
six : social decline . 65 deaths .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
and do guess what we found in the code of fear ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
and they did this with what we call lead-cards .
imagine that every single one is operated by people .
what about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
but instead of getting panicked , he just stopped .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had last half a year .
but somehow , we can get rid of this problem .
i like things that are strange . i like weird things .
i looked in the rustle , and it was a little bit pink .
it was always so inspiring , so capturing .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
i first ate him in a restaurant in southern spain .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
and these are now just the biohackers now , the individual people .
this is a clip from this code of the code of fear .
so i was looking at this , when is what , of course or intuitive .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity depends on our humanity .
this is what struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
so you should be put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
we &apos;re degrading a human being worth for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
finally , as we &apos;re proceeding , we should welcome fear .
there , in my think , there was a very good code .
that &apos;s actually the real confusion of man and machine .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
what about a set of new voices , never heard voices before ?
possibilities that would not have been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish was taken on a smooth trip .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
well , the living self lives its life continuously .
it &apos;s renewables , as they often call &quot; often .
and the best part about it is that they connect with magnets .
and that &apos;s where i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
the noted notes have the function of the letters of a script .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
at the last ted conference , i &apos;ve given an introduction to lhc .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
and i ask , how technically competent was this diagnosis ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
and i was like , &quot; well , how are you communicating ? &quot;
there was the core research system there was leopolds .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well , the two types of self record two terms of happiness .
photos like this : a building site along a much driving street .
i grew up with a wooden portion of science fiction .
an eight-hand brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensively , not intense .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control minerals prosperes .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really dabading .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
they increase the paralysis and they drove happiness .
what &apos;s interesting about this is , if i can take a little trip .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
a few of them . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
so a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so find programs that can care about the most former numbers .
how can a judge turn someone into something they &apos;re not ?
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the composer becomes more and more a friend you live with .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me .
and within a few years , lego moved to every household .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
here i &apos;m going to zoom in on a little bit . we &apos;re going to look right here .
so , when i was 15 , i decided to be a diver .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion imaging points , i think .
i always found fireflies in a glass .
from my angle of view , i looked up and down the janitor down .
many of you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-malile interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player is certainly beating three out of 10 beats .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work , by the way .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
she said it would be like a thunderly train of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to get worse .
again , so in any store , you can get things back .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
and she asked him , what are your hobies ?
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what makes you interest in them .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
that &apos;s where we have cases like diginotar .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft companions .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill it .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego room .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re preparing our lives for it .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go that way .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later for that .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
but bonobos : the other side of the medal
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going on to .
think of this as a imagery of this as a flying image of fly .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize of winner .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
most people usually start to orient themselves about the task .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our minds .
so the question is , can you get that to zero ?
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
a fish elevator , but also a avian reserve .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
yet , we &apos;re still coming up with the galapagos .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
because with marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
does i look like i could just write up a song ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
so now we &apos;ve faded the time scales again .
sometimes i lose the balance , and i &apos;m a story , at the end of it .
but of course , it &apos;s all the sum of all , a lot of ideas .
when they walk , yes , each footprint destroys the ground .
we can , of course , first of all , we can look at the waste problem .
only agree with precise times of time they agree .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
so , for example , shtz the environment , drive less cars .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that they have to face .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
most of you will be completely ignored by the remembering self .
and the online criminals are very easy to understand .
i &apos;d like to conclude with a story that i &apos;m really excited about .
so you can ask : how happy is this living self ?
does a single person in the audience ever see anyone die of masses ?
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
you can like to test it after my talk in your rooms .
now he talks about the phytoplankton mineral needs of phytoplankton .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
wr wants to help people who were convicted innocent .
and the best part about this may be what we expect in health .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgens .
that is , we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not harmful about that .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
they now have five-percent renewable energy rate .
but as you &apos;ve been talking to different people around the world about these possibilities .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
and if you can do , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is technological innovation that we have today .
they feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the origin .
bonobos , together with chimpanzees , are our next living relatives .
and this is the value of that experience , this kind of simple exercise .
the first of these traps is a contradiction to admit complexity .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
you &apos;re usually just wrong , and some of them don &apos;t come , some of them don &apos;t .
this deputy ran over to the older black one .
but i don &apos;t know how people are going to be terrible .
they spend most of their time in assembling structures constantly growing structures .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
i realize breathing with the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s supported .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
ceos &apos;s a little bit about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
this is one of the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
then the same thing happens in a good , fair conversation .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the next few years .
we all need to ultimately believe things that we can &apos;t see .
if we exaggerate it , we can pour a little bit back .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what allows us to modern progress .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
it &apos;s called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
that &apos;s the average size of a greenland iceberg .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
he said , &quot; there are no death penalty in germany .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
we record pictures of these mini-big bang into detectors .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack of he &apos;s supposed to go to first .
economists call this a pareto improvement .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
car colors , outcolor of the car -- i have 56 options .
and as general term , we can use the word intersexuality for that .
and of course , we all share the same adaptability .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
this is him lifting up a rare glicket .
so you can see , with this movie , we wanted to tell the real version .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
and i thought that was going to be so hard , so painful .
tempt will be part of the show , which is quite gone off .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed of it .
the scaffold from the ladazzles came out of the rest of the world .
okay . anyone who &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
you &apos;re basically learning how to read first before you only speak one word .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
a deception becomes something that , because someone perceives it that way .
bryan , they actually put a string here to vibrate here .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking about thinking , in a very important way .
and this game was played by college professors and so on .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis , and you know what ?
and she was much worse for a than she was for b in the memory .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it brings pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
all the parties , all the questions in society , supported this .
be further there for your contribution , whatever you want to be .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we record information ?
they knew all the bits and bytes they had to attack .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
and the suggestion was to build many more coal factories .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
the reason for that is , the government could track where a text came from .
so how are we going to operate the question of the character ?
and these apps will use our hands to improve our communities better .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i play computer games .
and today , we all feel like owners of our pop culture .
i wrote down four words up , and i &apos;d like to explain them a little bit .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
and we became , for a four and a half years to a real family .
and all i can say about this is , why do we fight that ?
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
because it &apos;s waking something that &apos;s lost , in a way , lost .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the story of anatomy .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
big data is being transformed into great opportunities for organizations around the world .
it &apos;s simultaneously a real-time 3d scan and a movement shot .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
you &apos;re agreed with him freely sniffs if it snips .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
by now , there are a lot of people working there , and they can all get involved .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
now why am i asking from my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening to ?
they &apos;re new nanotechnology on the way , nano-materials .
if you do review and you never make the mistake again .
listen consciously listen and tell if it tastes you or not taste .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system , will notice it .
but this picture , in fact , is completely put together , from photographs of different places .
to keep twins , right with the composer .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how good do you think are you about making the decisions ?
right now , we can get nutrients back in agriculture in this way .
he ended the whole process of thought , and he did something completely new .
beyond the simple games , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems that exist today .
at our views , we got into all sorts of inconvenient areas .
it was when italy won the world cup .
if i &apos;m not right , then the changer is not a man .
we not just tell stories when we go to tell stories .
and this then fires , in the headwords , open knowledge and citizen science .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
we can better deal with more categories than we deal with more choices .
the key tool of information facility has been stories since any time .
and that &apos;s the core cause of the biohackers .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire brigade .
because when the water comes out , it goes down in the atlantic .

what &apos;s important is , the creativity that is dominating in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
and then if you take good recordings , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .

in fact , we thought this was the end here , but we tried to get the process a little further .
it &apos;s now become the largest and one of the most important private avian reserves all over europe .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the light .

and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite those experiences .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
it was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed its world view very much .
the real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
if you have 10 teams that typical , you get about six structures that have stable structures .
there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time has missed a lot of biology .
they live in a world that has information and communications , as no one could have predicted .
i tried to make clear how valuable cities are , to value how much more valuable they are than they cost .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipedideset .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
if you found an article with false thought good , you could feel the creator of these thoughts .
in holland , of course , you understand it easier , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
if we can do this , then this current data trap so far , maybe a new source of information .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of adversity , a perception of the icon , is a sense of our own power .
the challenge offers a common experience , or maintaining , to build the right prototype .
this is one of the pictures that we &apos;ve held with what we call the gigapix technology .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only want for effort on their own .
today , we want to talk about how video becomes vial , and then finally why this is important .

and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to do , because it urges people to work very quickly .
but danny , all over american pursuit is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
there are very , very few things you can even say about , of which there is a chance in a million .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .
our language increases the social change that , in many cases , have been triggered by a technological change .
i &apos;m regret there , but i &apos;m trying to learn the best way to pass it to others .
that was the reason . it was the excellence . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
so this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
and i noticed how much these deep diving things looked like a space mission .
so the achievement of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , adding myself , adding myself at the same time .
so the idea is that we actually bring together the people involved where they put things together , collectively do .
there are such controversial things like all of these genetically engineered plants on the checkles .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really drought shapes .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all of these pictures , you can set up your own collection .
because the ground is that mosses will die off , and the wind and the water washing away .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
so , as citizens , you &apos;re being able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
it &apos;s how happy or happy the person is when that person thinks about their lives .

at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process when you push on the trigger .
and yes , the discussion is all about the question , how far can you take away a piece of the future there ?
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 parts as you know it from documentations .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population have permanently lost their voting right .
we lose three million tons of phosphorus of phosphorus that really need to go back in circles .
if anyone had built a two-inch construction , they would have carried the price home .
and every time it divided , the chemicals that found have been distributed to the same amounts of it .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger is expressed .
and the result is , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m refused to the adication .
but not only that -- that merge and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever did .
yet , my interest in photography when i got my first digital camera , started at the age of 15 .
for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney concert hall .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that &apos;s indian , but it &apos;s also very time-time-time .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and it seemed to have something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re being taken by the mind . how can you be harmed ?
so he says this actually makes sense , because players can do more online worlds than in real life in online .
adversity are not an obstacle that we need to deal to get better with our lives .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to its level of the game , right ?
imagine that this artificial intelligence provides every mobile phone owner .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
as you can see , the lagoon was around palms and around a few mangroves around it .
sure , i &apos;m going to have out some color pots out of it , but i &apos;m going to get new ones like them .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you also have to be able to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them around , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following one .
but the challenge is to try and figure out which they are and why we keep them , and do they make sense ?
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s probably determined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles away from the next ocean .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they contribute through throwing away to the diversity of species .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
some of you may have heard about this that i turned on an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
maybe you can stand up for a second so that they can talk at recess with both the project .
and i was catapulted by a piece of puzzle to the next one of the puzzle didn &apos;t fit together .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are , or how big the pictures are .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this in itself can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
if you want to know how sea level is going through the ice melts , it flights into the sea .
in fact , it &apos;s so stuck in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite parts of this picture until i &apos;m really on the cracks .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
all , i suddenly realize that appearance is increasingly unimportant to success , just the usability is going to become a app .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it away now .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in california are they not going to get the correct answer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what genetic code is going to look like .
and then when i come there with my little v piesel and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling comes up .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same kind of typewriter .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
now , since the movie had with the sundance movie festival , we can look at this .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so much rooted in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
so if you want to have it better , you have to cross up here and hold your percentage of the revenue .
and the first thing i &apos;m asking the question i &apos;m , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
so , in the present , we have a very modern example that keeps up the dayspapers of time .
it lives in the deep sea , about a year and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures .
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , otto normal consumers .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anyone else on the planet .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature , and it &apos;s all connected .
they can only be taken in relation with some other chemicals about oral that the mao .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
and we don &apos;t tell us a favor if we make them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
we had a team that was working on a project in boston that took three people for two and a half months .
his uncle flew into the diaspora with her holiness that brought people to nepal with her .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seven-year-old team and the prime minister at the same time .

we should call it , what it is , a commercial in wrap , a commercial that quickly asks ecological capital that allows exactly this production to happen .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is advertising -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now if i touch you here ? &quot;
now , as we go on and we care for age , say 40 years or younger , we see that even the main thing that people should worry about .
they &apos;re also interested in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics , and combining it in a pretty disruptive way .
and these scientists have just documented the different issues that these ceo is engaging with , and how much time they spent making decisions about the topics .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i &apos;d have celebrated the nails somewhere .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do that , because this love story , as romantic , is also revealing .

if people took this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything upside down , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
then the size of the semantic cross-connection and abundance that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can &apos;t really hardly imagine it .

and since there were neither video games nor this overlawl with computer-generated movies or all the whole image language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental physicists , who need a good percentage logic to put together the complex ideas .

the head of congress came up onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of disease burden and 1.3 percent of health care employees .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world we live in , this interactive world belongs to us .
so i stood back there with a little team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar with a new technique that had not been around before .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nudelparties and searching , tony drew for the first time after seven years .
we &apos;re going to turn on it , and we &apos;re going to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
how to increase happiness is very different dependent on how you think , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the life self .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you like this . &quot;
but recent dna evidence recently shows that the etrusers , who later formed the roman empire have the same dna as the old lydians .
and then we have this is not compound , but that &apos;s yes , i think , has been doing relatively well , people are right convinced of like this .
so , that really hurt my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and then on a cloudy day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke in , and i said maybe again .
we have a comic about it . we have level high for local understanding , knowledge interconnectivity , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .

bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonable , you &apos;re only in the 1000s .

and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world when we attack the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are on the verge of an epic victory .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is receiving 35 million hits every month .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science at the time we saw them , there &apos;s no words for all .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is , which happened in the formula one in the past few decades .
and then you go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , a cassette player , radio , amplifier , and in this one electronics business , there are so many stereo facilities .

and then the next ones that already been working with a nem neural model or mental model like the software , eergonomists , which is you would have had an idea of something , the metaphor of a desktop , to use the computer .
instead , what i do , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing is , we think at a certain level of abstraction , we &apos;re giving this machine , and the machine is doing something that will overwhelds our capabilities far , better and faster than we could ever do it ourselves .
but this is my prototype like , which is my prototype , which was pretty much divorced , such a branch like this , attached electronics on and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , the thing had broken .
it was on a music student school professor at my beloved old teacher , professor jzurge , a well-known beethoven , a well-known beethoven , concert pianist and slow year-old professor of music school here in school here in school .
we took a ps3 camera , we put it apart , we put it down , we put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s accessible free -- you can provide the code for free .
we look inside this web , and we see the fifty hertz , and when it gets nine-twenty nine hertz , we &apos;ll catch some valves , then a little beep goes in again , a little merb of merb steam goes in again , we &apos;ll get back up again .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we made them work in government .

the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s warf or siamesian twins , whether it &apos;s intersexual -- surgeons are often adapted to the norm is not because this would be adapted to their physical health .
so there are huge challenges here . there are challenges with transmission , for example , if we say the energy source of energy is outside the country , not just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of that energy is coming from where else .
so , what does that mean , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how do we think about the place of people in evolution , and most importantly how we look at the next phase , i would say there are a number of possibilities .
but , as we think , the only way so biology will have a huge impact without further increase the cost of food or the limitation of its availability that &apos;s availability is when we see co2 as the output material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that are going that path .
i started working through scientific literature about how these centrifuels are built in natance , and i found that they &apos;re structured in something called the cascades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuels .
now the fascinating thing is that the betadcolor oline , which are contains in the liane are mao-inhibitors of the just the way necessary to potentially potentially the tryptamins , so ask yourself .
this is a problem because warming is looking at the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s a lot of frozen carbon , which , as it looks up from microbes to methane .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to let it happen slowly and creepy -- obviously trying to desperate wareengineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind very quickly .
so maybe this technological change may be clear because dependent that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every human being in society can do something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes an information technology makes great spraps on the curve of moore &apos;s law , doubling the price performance quotient every 12 to 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve sort of aware of ourselves , &quot; okay , there &apos;s now as a real scene now , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always chatting there and so on .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do because our science makes so advances in the field of anatomy , that we &apos;re reaching a point where we need to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could fall apart ?
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make divert and we could use less use less , but on average , that number will go up every year and so doubling more than double , the number of services are being provided per person .
i graduated , and i hope the video works , bring in a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelor work of michael burk , ann-kathrin krence , joris klause and jan-moritz .
and there &apos;s even better yet , the things you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photographs , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology , are now literally being materialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
heinrich , because you assume he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell them he &apos;s the mit xy -- because you assume it &apos;s male , he can now be brought in what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .

and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices , because things should be more intuitive , more and more natural , user-more natural , and that &apos;s where you have to look , which is actually , of course , is user-user-friendly or intuitive .
are you not afraid that you &apos;re going to go your life for this hand and never arise anything out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die in a scraped dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of the failure ?
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn into our best version , and immediately are willing to solve persistent to solve the problem for as long as we needed , try it again after the failure .
and because i was born without washing legs , and my feet were focused on them , and i only had a few toes on this one , and a few toes on the other side , he was the overcreader , this stranger had to overcome the bad news .
and finally , i think that although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and so stimulating , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not being measured by our technology , not the things that we develop , not in our intellect and minds .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to conclude with that sentence a and again the clue again , designers also have to think differently , to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .

i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i suspected the useless experiments of his teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind as to assume that our scientific ideas are endless , that there are no mysteries in nature , that there are no mysteries in nature , that there are no mysteries in nature , and there are no new worlds to assume that there are no new worlds to assume that there are no new worlds to assume that there are no new worlds , and there are no new worlds to assume that there are no new worlds in nature of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the human mind than to assume that there are endar
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere where we take our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re being stealed by the seen , and hopefully , one after one , one after one , they &apos;ll adopt the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserved to exist in a different way that we can find a way of living in a really multicultural world where we can find a really multicist in our well-being .
one of them is required by the great selection of different salatdressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which salatdressing is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better , and what &apos;s happened is this visually led to reingret the decision , and this adverteur the decision you made of happiness negative on the happiness that you made of your decision .

and what i found was really extraordinary is that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won at a second grade competition , whether i was walking along with the parade to hallobby , whether i had my scholarship or one of my sports settings , and he used these clipts to teach his students , and he was using these clippets to teach his students , and he was in medical school .
and if you have people in front of you who are the most strong belief that they have a soul , or you can also say , who believe that they &apos;ve been woven up by the soul to life , they think it &apos;s sort of as a violin frame about them , not matter , they just from flesh and blood , sort of a stone , sort of a stone , sort of peculicious , yes .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- along with my professional patti and my colleague , jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we were to use computers , instead of a mouse timeline , who moves like a digital fingertip on a flat workplace -- what if we could intervene with both hands and grab data and grab them the way would we could we want ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this up my talk , which is that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired out of the bird age , and that have gone a little bit like this in the machine age , that we can be activated with the help of the so-called cyber age , and that we can actually activated in this way , about complex , technological products , in fact , but actually come back to our future , but actually come back to our future , but actually come back to our future , but actually come back to our talk to our own .
at this point , jafour said to octavio said , &quot; what happens when we take a invaded area of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- part of the american message , a part of the american message , part of the canadian messages -- and if people want to work under the canadian rules or the united states , can they would work there , and can do everything on the area of these messages , or the united states , &quot;

i want to end with a poem that was captured by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , that my friend jacques demis told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; every child knows god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , and he says , he says , &quot;
when someone &apos;s made the trouble and complained all these sacred and told who they are all of these sacred model of other people are , then my picture is being enriched with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , into this room , into these metaversy that use photos of other people , and therefore some kind of overwhelming social use of social use of other service of other service .
a huge energy story , but again , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and then we have two thousand six , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to go small and go back and dedicate to the next topic of the future , and that is again , and that is again the same crazy again , which is the same crazy again , which is going to start by the fact that &apos;s not going to store everything , we &apos;re store .
there doesn &apos;t stay much space for it in the malaria samps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but you still , through time and ritual , shaped a mysterious nimbus that &apos;s not based on the idea of being aware , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s breathed into the human consciousness .
so that the system evolved to create baccups , which make it easier to make mistakes that people inevitable , and it also allows them to create loving , supportive spaces where anyone who observes health care can actually addressing things that are potential errors and will even be rewarded for people who make mistakes and rewarded for the gradation of that .
in fact , i &apos;ve discussed with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who initiated the psychedelic ea with discovering the magic mushrooms in mexico in the &apos; 30s , and i &apos;m saying that you couldn &apos;t put these tryptamins as hallucinogen , because where you feel the impact you &apos;re not there to experience the impact you &apos;re not there to experience a hallucination .

for example , women who would reach the voting right to voting , the concept of founding fathers , who says that anatomical common than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and an ovaries is not significant enough that we shouldn &apos;t have the voting to have the right to have the right to ownership ownership ownership ownership , etc . &quot;
now we all use , or many of us , email , or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly distributed in total itarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign providers like gmail , because they know that they can trust them more than local vendors , and they &apos;re encrypted on ssl connections , so that the local government can &apos;t sniff around in their conversation .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in the nasa expert council and planning real space missions , and they go to russia , go through mission , the biomedical protocol is all in it and then they go to the international space station and take our 3d camera with our 3d camera .
in my program , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the rescue assistant assistant to the box of the cardiologists say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about your microphone .
if you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the shine of it , and all the technology around it , all the technology around it , all the technology , and the difficulty , if you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain the other people . it &apos;s like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something together , and know you can never explain to anybody .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i give you permission -- and maybe you can throw a look at kathryn schultz &apos; book , which is why nothing else , because nothing else in this talk will make sense of you .
a few years ago , the lasker prize was told to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research where he took a adult skin , a fibrocist , and by manipulating just four genes that induced cell to lead it to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all sorts of batteries that are made : the for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i compared to the amount of electronic energy that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing now could store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which are eventually formed over the last 130,000 years ago .
this is a reconstruction by the cathedral notre dame who was done only on the computer with images of flickr . just type in notre lady in flickr , and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university terrain and so on , and each of those orange cups and so on , and each of those orange clones represents a picture that was heard as this model .
we cleaned the chromosome of a species of microbes , and roughly said , these two are as far from one other as humans and mice , and we gave some extra genes to that we could select this chromosome . we took it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very enriched graphs here .
when a no said , the vetopcattle , that completely crashed you . i &apos;ve spent 10 years , i &apos;ve spent a hard time asking whether i might really waste my great engineering to a insane thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues have always talked to him , you &apos;ve made out the money out to the window in your child .
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s going to happen to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient believes firmingly enough on it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
i &apos;d like to just point out right one of the original data sets of noah data , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , the photosynd technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , it was her greatest fear , that as we move towards a thread , ford-growth , general world view , do not only would we reduce the entire range of human imagination in a thoughtful way of thinking , but one day we &apos;ll wake up from a dream , and forgotten that there were ever other possibilities .
and so the idea , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems is to invest in something that you just have something later -- and you get to the investment is not that clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , that &apos;s not a big drama .
i once went to travel with a young colleague 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china across southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of the statistics that you hear about : 6,000 holy monuments that were murdered into rubble and ashes , 1.2 million people who were murdered by the casting revolution .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re focusing people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher , if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the ticket is black and the victim knows -- in the same states where the same states is rowing up to be borrowing .
i had such an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , which was now more than 90 , but she told me that she was a long denser for her entire life , and she told me that she grew up in the northern virginia , and she said she could feel and hear how a poem coming across the landscape .
it means that a little kid from the people who grows up in the belief that the mountain is an a.pu spirit who will be his or determine her destiny , will become a very different person , and will have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little kid from montana , who grows up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be discharged .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are going to come up , and i thought , since i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really do , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here with these incredible jumps forward , which is so quickly happening , that we can barely happen , that we can barely keep up .
and that would be your answer to the bjstockn lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from it , the poverty reduction , and so on that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money while there are better things that we can do .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve legally acquired it by using trojans , for example , to grab money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keylogiciaries , who collected our credit card information on the keyboard while we &apos;re buying an infected computer online .
and they got there two tinkerers running down , and they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll make it easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve just got out of open source , which is freely available hardware , electronics , built this device is assembled together , and now they &apos;ve even the cheapest provider of these devices in the world .
woman parks used to come back to montgomery , where she met two of her oldest friends . these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery bus boykott -- an incredible african-american woman -- and virginia durr , a white man , clifford durr , dr. king .
this made me to another person than my friends under the kwakutl , who believe that these forests were the location of hukuk and the curved heaven heaven heaven beaks and the cannican live in the north of the world , spirits that live in their hamasations .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering locked the draper prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists who developed regardless of each other developed &apos;s natural process to work faster and lead to desirable proteins in an efficient way -- which frances arnold calls &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
and now , towards biology , and here i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology is that biology is actually an science of information , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code that is yes , it &apos;s not quite equal as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter , and not just cyber .
bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far as to say that this mass media , he means the book and the picture , not the tv , the internet , and so on what we now call mass media today , that this mass media has fossilized our memories and have to virtualize our ability to virtualize our ability .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never leave that again -- to buy the name rights at the talk that you &apos;re seeing right now , who didn &apos;t have a title or a lot of content , and not a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence about what the topic would be .
this sentence of dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on master a challenge without impacting by mating the experience , as if my life had gone so successful , because i could perceive the possible fall of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people perceive me with my disability .
and when these people would come and saw who was the best protein folder in the world , this wasn &apos;t a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working on a rehab clinic at night , and he was the best protein oranger in the world at night .
this was , of course , was just a simple trick by dr. p. , so that i didn &apos;t want to do , in an idea that richer five year-old girls in the hospital are in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , and so it became a new and promising experience .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for this past to do that , i &apos;ve also looked for in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , to see if they might have better or more reasonable ideas about it than we could help creative people deal with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
so we have such a situation where , the further our science continues , we have to admit around so more that these categories that we thought would be stable anatomical categories that made very simple arrangements to create permanent identity categories are much more sharp than we thought .
so i went home and i ate with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should figure out a way to control things , then we should figure out a laser , so that he could do graffiti again , it would be great . &quot;
you can see down here in the picture , you can see in leadership , you can see a job for a mated garage with all sorts of lab scaffolding that college has empowered out , a group in paris , which has come up with something , and is pretty interesting things , and i also want to do quite interesting things , and i also want to cut a project .
i recommend all of you to read steve book , or to look at the movie , so that not only understand the wonderful interconnectedness that has come out between these two men , but also how music helped connect it , and how it finally , the instrument was allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel way from the street .
and if i transmission this now , for example , where i &apos;m guiding as an overview , selecting as an selection , informed in the case , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transsadder is , i can also throw this somewhere or buy somebody or buy somebody or buy and buy and so on .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people keep asking me to tell how i deal with adversity , and i &apos;m going to admit something : this sentence has never fits for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer people &apos;s questions , and i think , gradually , gradually , i understand why .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and filtrate the secret societies that were the bedrock of duvalier and tonton macoutes and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies .
and so there &apos;s different ones , but the beauty of this is that a uranium molecule has one million times as much energy , say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re primarily the radiation , the footprint and the cost , is playing the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in your own league .
no biologist , for example , would dare to say that 50 percent or more of all species are on the same before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this one -- the apocalyptic scenarium in the field of biodiversity -- corresponds hardly what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic scenarium in the field of cultural diversity .
bg : now we haven &apos;t set out on a place yet , and there are a lot of interesting rules for everything that fuses nuclear on behalf . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the company were in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve met the energy minister of energy agenda .
the computer vision algorithms have held these pictures together so that they disagree the real room where these images , all of them have been made near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , and you can see elements of stabilized slides or panoran imagery , and these things were all spatially related to each other .
and then if you look at the software that we just saw on it , you &apos;ll also understand why nine-year-old percent of our software today is not more intuitive or not useful or not useful on the i-pad is embedded in many areas or i-phone in many areas or i-phone , even though it &apos;s far more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- means to someone who knows nothing , and is most likely sick , and therefore not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namely the patient .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study of the people at ing -- employees who all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they &apos;ve signed their participation for their retirement savings .
if i want to bring you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data that we &apos;re consuming is bigger than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about information overlap , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns emerge and we can see trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have become visible .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine being that was believed that would literally live in the walls of an artist -- sort of like dobby , the houseed -- that came out and make the artist in a sense of work .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the tyfood process of sophieat , pray , love , and i fell into one of those pit of the doubt that we all fall on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster , and it becomes the worst book ever written .
we also put one of those same aggregate the same size that he stands there , put it into the hall to actually simulate the complete dynamic behavior of this net , so in the hall it looks like this , and it looks like this , and here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole implementating the net with .
what &apos;s interesting historical footnote : when the mopes conquered south spain , they brought this use . the language changed over the centuries of sophiallah , allah , allah , to sophiol√© , ol√© , ol√© sophiol√© , that you still fight and hear flamcoencotches .
now today , if you want to run a race , you actually need something like this one -- something that the car monitores in real time , has a few thousand sensors that give information from the car , you pass that information to the system , and then use it and then use it to send things back to this car and change things in real time while information is collected .
i was afraid , not so much , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could fall into one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship with the greolin if i started talking about scale leaders and arpegos and other exciting forms of didactic pegactic peactic peacotic peacuts .
so , the fact is , in the 20th century , you will not remember your wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era in which we &apos;ve been against and an era in which we &apos;ve been against and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth are either actively supported or passively accepted , so the problem is not the change .
i &apos;d written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which would shoot the metric in terms of visual effects and computer-generated effects into all new heights , expressive human , expressive characters that had been made using cg , and the main figures should all be cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably heard , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably part of the generation that was healthy for this bad green image , because i &apos;ve already started studying machine construction in carlboard , i &apos;ve already started studying machine construction in carlboard , technical college , now she says , kit .
you know ? i think to allow an mere person to think he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the vessel and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , unknown , infinite mysteriy , is a little bit too much responsibility for burst you to a fragile , human psyche .
if you should ever have the chance of working at your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , you all do -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government because of many different problems , including that there &apos;s a thylal in their house .
you know , one of the great verners of traveling , and one of the joys on ethnographic research is to live together with the people who can still remember the old days , who still feel their past in the wind , touch stones , touch them on the rain , touch in the bitter leaves of the plants .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s prize , even though they swinging you in a concrease , and the best friend confronts you with it and my an awful discussion , but when at the end of the day , it leads , and you &apos;re never going to make such a mistake like that .
it &apos;s actually the one who makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had a patient who had , say two representations in two different surgeons , and decide which to choose which one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to be selected .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and at the same time , the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t care to me that it doesn &apos;t emitted co2 , i almost wish it could do that , but i &apos;ll probably accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who reported a story . &#91; unclear -- he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the shot , there was a terrible circular sound .
the actually the beauty about this is , if you do that , you make agriculture , you create biogas , on a hectare of land that has five thousand people in favelas , so a farmer can produce about a thousand dollars , and the facility is waiting to grow chickens and vegetables and vegetables and fish .
we &apos;re amazing on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we need to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we &apos;ve fought progress in which we &apos;ve empowered over these things more primarily than now .
so by comparing color , contrast and brightness to the edges to the individual images , photographic deficiency , like a rock depth , decreased color and disorders , we &apos;re wiping the limits between the different images and let them look like a single picture , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
if i went to a room full of colleagues and i asked for their instantaneous support and i started to tell you what i just told you about , i would very probably not reach the end of the second story before it really awkward to you , anyone would go a joke , they &apos;d change the topic and forget the rest of it .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures have not fused to decline . these are dynamically living peoples , whose existence is displaced by recognized forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s the tremendous deforestation in the home of the homeland of the penan , a nomadic people from south of the penan , a nomadic people from the forest , from the forest , where they have now have now , where they have now have been discarcerated from the forest , where they have been escape , where they have been discarded in the forest , where they have been captured by the forest , where they have been captured by the forest , where they have been discarcerated from the forest , where they have been disawaic , or where they have been discarded from the forest , where they have been discarcer
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content online to actually be realistic for them and they actually live their real lives without oil . so , when they sign up to the game , tell us where they live , and then you get news movies in real time that show them how much oil costs , which doesn &apos;t exist , what doesn &apos;t exist , what it is impaired , how transportation is , how transportation is closed , how transportation is closed , and ask out if they need to find out how much oil costs to find out how much oil costs them to find out how much oil costs to find out how much oil costs , and ask them to find out how much oil costs , and then they need to find out how much oil costs them to find out how much oil costs , and ask them how much oil costs , and then they need to find out how much oil costs you to find out how much oil costs them how much oil costs
what ayahuasca does so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparate , but it &apos;s really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s these wooden liane liane that is a series of betacerine , harmin , harmin , is slightly hallucinogens , is slightly hallucinogens , is sort of hallucines alone , but it &apos;s also a blue trator is about their petrator is about their family &apos;s called a blue petris mixing with the skin mixed with the coffee mixed with the coffee mixed with the skin mixing with the coffee boes out of the house with the one hand , but it &apos;s name of the one hand , but it &apos;s name of the house with the house with the one hand , but it &apos;s covered with the plant with the plant alone , but it &apos;s called a blue , but it &apos;s called a
just knowing that jaguar shamberes are still traveling beyond the milky way galaxy , or the meaning of the oldest of the oldest of inuit still meaningful , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist still tracking the heart of the dharma means to memory is the thought that the world in which is the idea that the world in which we live in , not in an absolute sense , but a sense of the reality , but a certain generations ago of the possibilities of the possibilities that our possibilities of the possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our possibilities that our adaptation of the way , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , as many generations ago , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally , equally
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this interconnectedness manipulated in the life of a four-year-old girl &apos;s life when she was speaking to her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , for five days and nights together in a little boat in the chinese ocean for five days ago . a interconnectedness that sane in the life of this little girl -- now , and now , and now , now , now , now , now , now speaking today , now , and now , and now , and now , now , and now , which now , which now , and now , and now speaking to you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s penan in the borneo forest , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warrior the warrior in the caisut-desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the anden , or a carawance in the middle of the sahara , which is happening to go to the desert for a month ago , or a month ago , or a caraeyum , or even belyma , or the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s guest .
