it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid is a real alley , and it keeps millions of people from the bloom .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those that make mistakes and those that don &apos;t make -- those who constrains sleep deprivation and those who have bad results and the results with bad results and the results .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , are high , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human participation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
