that &apos;s why , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get the energy even in times if they &apos;re not available .
when i was another kid , there was the future was somewhere in the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without raping the country they live on .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what we need .
we &apos;ve lost trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but eating this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end of it .
i loved walking to this business , but at a point i wondered , well , how come you never buy anything ?
and i wonder what would they choose , because i often asked my friends this question lately , and they all wanted to go into the past .
very direct advertising , not for puma per se , but that now they &apos;re helping these company succeed .
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , which they would eat in the wild .
so the idea is , besides that brands are part of life , actually , get them to finance the movie ?
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a framework where it &apos;s becoming much more accessible .
when you put yourself on that path where belief and magic replace evidence and science , they get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
and i called them up , and i tapped on their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and into the data .
so you have to deal with this , which does that mean , and not only do you change it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and this is something that &apos;s growing through the complexity that people use it with , and its benefit of the user , as it &apos;s getting bigger and bigger as it .
now if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did it .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle 1979 , on the same day , at the same moment , each one is a baby -- okay .
are you not afraid that you write down your whole life and never creating a book that anybody in the world is interested in ? never again ?
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little crazy and also have a vision .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new groups of genes .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know all of you have seen such a performance before your life .
we &apos;re bringing our children and closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , regardless of whether that means doing all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get you ways and not getting good grade in my course .
that means that each atom at the same time is in two different places , which simultaneously means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
and it connects all of us together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and is also able to evolve faster than we have been before .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also hardly hitting the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
bill , i think i speak for almost all the people here when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria already , do you realize that each of us in our gut is doing more bacteria than cells in the rest of our body ?
unfortunately , sometimes even children who are trying to refind their parents , who , in some cases , have not seen for a decade .
and this ability to virtualize virtual virtuals reality , people had needed in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything at all .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about preserving people alive , and it &apos;s becoming the highest time to understand what that means .
i combined it with my earlier preference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because when i used the camera , more , the process was in planning .
and we hope , of course , that we stop similar , and then we &apos;re also similar , so that stop can get more involved , so that stop can also get more involved in people as well .
and he drew again for the first time , in both of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
and they could have combined them to government services if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
now it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;re got enough curiosity there and you have enough energy in there , you get a way .
the same technology that the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can not just protection from themselves , but can also serve immunity against other viruses .
okay , let &apos;s rethink that : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures their success in your predators &apos;s health .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after playing with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally overlook the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by strengthening society .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really catch , but i always want to make it look like she could have done , in a picture .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i was talking about -- the psychological constructs that protect you from the consequences of your work .
now , that &apos;s kind of sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not what she actually started like this , and what &apos;s actually started like this , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
now , when we telephone a few weeks ago , they mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup poll .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do all the designers start to deal with so natural , archaical causes of communication , interaction and so on ?
and it worked . again , we &apos;d created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;d been playing a little bit more money with the movie .
now , for those of us who &apos;ve given up government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , the world that we want to leave to our children .
and i can tell that for the reason that now we live in an epidemic of fear as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see again .
now there are some of us who forget , in a way , that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , i mean , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
and then your pupils expand , and they &apos;ve bumped in front of your head , and they look hard , and they start telling their stories .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think they &apos;re the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
it &apos;s not going to take long time , until the reality to be that there will be the 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be more accessible to everybody .
it also puts me excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s probably not that dumb and it &apos;s going through the skin just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
a place where women are leading the ceptor , say , with sex , &apos; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
we think it &apos;s because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , did a human being deserves to die for one of it &apos;s him ?
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical thing . but not the normal thing . and would you really want to know this poor , gray person if you really were ?
and if you also , as an informed citizen , you want to make meaningful decisions in society and want to talk to you , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no one .
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that he was driving on a highway street in los angeles one day , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
so that &apos;s important , because you can only look at websites in this way , looking at the entire internet course in the same way .
and then when all fingers go on time and just as it is in the notes , sounds come out , sounds like music together that sound like music together .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of artists and designers .
so what it means is that we have this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions again and again and again , whether we should work or shouldn &apos;t work .
and in a few hours , he landes and he rents a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those amazing ted dinner tonight .
this prospect that , inside the front of the bub , he already knew that it was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud .
i think we would all have to express the mood that woody expressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
anyway , from the part that had to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was curious . it was curious . it was imagination .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically has only the present .
and that &apos;s , yes , this is usually quite young people , but the only thing that really adds you all of you all of you is this fascination of the technology .
she took me outside and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you &apos;re not going to say it any other . &quot;
over the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read you , and then i ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
we &apos;re light years from improving people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
it got all silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever recover for systematic killing people again .
what i &apos;d like to do is i make a movie about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole movie is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody &apos;s gone to a plane this morning and just flies to los angeles , and right now they &apos;s over ohio right now .
it doesn &apos;t prefer to do it particularly scientifically -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea , and asks the patients , relatives , &quot; how &apos;s it going ?
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night , i got a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see her .
if people have freedom , then each of us is for ourselves to do the things that maximize our well-being and no one has to decide for us .
then carr leaned up to me , put a finger on my face , and so you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then make it sound about an instrument .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always on a year back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we took eight of their family because it needed to be .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me , as the woman walking around here at ted in her underwear -- means i &apos;ve found some things .
and if you have this premise in front of you , you understand the logic with which we &apos;re experiencing this happiness to be able to improve our world through a lie .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been told today is very touching by me because many , many , beautiful expressions were in the ones that i &apos;ve also lived through .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ?
when i look ahead in the next decade , i &apos;m very sure of two things : that we can create any imaginable future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
we were told later that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it would take over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth addressing some really known brands .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s led and decided by us as an individual , in the decisions we make .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear someone talk about your mistakes .
this will definitely be an energy carrier that will then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or sh , that &apos;s going to be .
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities competing for new residents ?
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to worry about questions of democracy .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach out the fact that we reach beyond our limitations is the value of things like the lhc .
you know , there are many challenges left , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
and most of all , i just want to give you who see the same thing , just say , don &apos;t give up the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare it .
i grew up on the countryside , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year younger sister a year .
you can see we surf on the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new block of housing , provided the laws there would support this and not prevent it .
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to evolve ?
we trust that somebody is time with us , that the rules are held , that we have the same goal and we remain with the end .
only when you take another example , so if she immediately makes the one pile bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , he doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t need anything to do it .
you can know how happy someone is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy they live and vice versa .
then she said , &quot; next thing i decided to say you will always do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
so we have a situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
now , that &apos;s good , besides paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying how valuable you are , and that people should just stop jamming .
so it looks something like who has no freedom of freedom can &apos;t also be drawn for its actions and claims , and therefore it &apos;s unsustainable .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is advertising -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now if i touch you here ? &quot;
now , as we go on and we care for age , say 40 years or younger , we see that even the main thing that people should worry about .
and these scientists have just documented the different issues that these ceo is engaging with , and how much time they spent making decisions about the topics .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do that , because this love story , as romantic , is also revealing .
it was expressed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material digestive , and so we ended up with just having one cell with a new chromosome .
and by the way , we migrate and circulate and mix us so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statements .
well , i hope that you &apos;ll agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a lot of meaning for change .
but in the mid-1990s , we realized that we were in creaturedesign and so-design -- which we actually started the company for -- which we actually started the company for -- came too slow forward .
if people took this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything upside down , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can &apos;t really hardly imagine it .
i just made a poll of over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that , according to a typical american in a day is 70 .
and if you want to go to 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the power right now , you have to turn off that el off that el .
that is , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized , in masses of memories that we can hang on our personal memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
it depends on a third set that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , which it pretends and provided .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual people are not just in the middle of the gender spectrum -- in a way , they can be distributed across the entire range .
the second case is a change in experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between being happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life or happy with his life .
that &apos;s a people who are not cognitively different between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is equivalent to the forest that people depend on .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflect in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variants of ayahuasca , all of you see at a great distance in the forest that seem as a kind of our eyes .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , let it as many people see as possible .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to those of us who have traveled to this distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing is the epiphany other , because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
that our system also has a price increase in price , is that we &apos;re doing 20 percent with this el , and we &apos;re not going to go down a price increase on the other things .
we &apos;ve only phosphorus for two years , and now a lot more uranium mining around the world , there &apos;s a lot more uranium than it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
and as far as the isolation goes , if we colonize as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and the changes in the environment that evolution could produce in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you might think that a director must be able to lead , a leader , like a ship captain or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
by sending her home , i was putting a quiet voice inside me , trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
you get into this capsule , then you &apos;re floating down into this dark hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescue is , if you don &apos;t make it back .
so from therefore you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that defense to yes , to the idea that a hundred percent renewables is yes .
and from my point of view , the scientific ways of trying to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a place when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we do , and because they only live three to six months , they disagree in their weight , they &apos;re a little 30 billion people in energy use .
now , if you do the math , people would buy six times more like melting a glass of melting , who they had six to choice than if they had 24 to the selection .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
but i think in this frame here , and intent , to make a deception something real thing , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage like this .
but we programmed for over two weeks , we went to the beach in venice , my kids were brought in , my dog , and we created this .
and because the government ultimately , the government ultimately , reminds your power out of us -- as we think about it , &quot; we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
so now it &apos;s that far . and for those of you who haven &apos;t been there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever addressed -- 27 miles across .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about explaining the absolutely insane mood of the creative process .
so an app written in a few days , and then it spreads from rough , is a kind of shot to the bay to the institution of the government .
what this means is that if you were to meet someone , and you &apos;d tell them , oh , his father &apos;s a two-foot man , how much would you know about their size ?
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to face the big challenges of the planet .
at this point , and when you laugh , you can see how important this lie is and how much time do you need to know something that artists can share very well .
let &apos;s transfer back to my medical world of medicine , where i feel about much more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely that i &apos;ve talked to you about that .
we now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
but then another very interesting step happened , where things became completely different , which is , these cells started communicating and exchange information so that communities emerged of cells .
one of the areas in which we see this to the beipiel , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states today , are the fighting about the beginning and the end of life .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected linking that we form are the real nutrition of creativity .
and i &apos;ve argued that maybe we may be to create a new form of the cambrian explosion where there might be massive new educational .
i said out loud : listen , you thing , you and i both know , if this book is not completely my fault , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state let people sit down , especially if below that were unproportionately a lot of jews .
and if you &apos;ve got there already that the stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the usage is a science for itself .
that &apos;s what we all had to do that time . when we read a book , we took the description of the author and we projected it on the canvas in our heads .
we came up with the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in my own education .
the reason is that used to be better than everything was worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for the people who were a pleasant surprise .
but also , because it turns out that , by using all this time on play all the time , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
bg : now we need one of those scalable , electricity generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then we use 20 years to use it .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i took several months to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances up here , looking up there , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise .
you have to imagine so that if you do something of the classical soda , you need five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , you just one hour to do .
so far , in discussions are always tried to do these insulanders , they &apos;re doing auctar , they have a little network , and it has to do with our compounds .
the other note says , whether we &apos;re going to use zero emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
and so in berlin , we decided to build a hall where we could sort of map the electric rations of the island at scale one to three precisely .
now , what i &apos;m hearing all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormonoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
as you knew back in the village , who &apos;s got something with who &apos;s got something with who &apos;s happening about this extension of our self from these mobile end devices at the global scale .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play some kind of game together to better control their health .
and imagine , even though i &apos;ve negotiated it as a five-year-old kid with dr. p. trying to stop those practice , naturally without success .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental physicists , who need a good percentage logic to put together the complex ideas .
at every step , we produced these pieces in the surplus so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and places and a world of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
when we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us , &quot; i have a dream of speech , &quot; a kind of solution to it .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was acting like this , and so i would be able to care of my patients without having to contact him .
i got i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t go on the bike route , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive along the bike track .
unlike the one-page conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way of part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
when i tell you that someone put their life as eight on a scale of 10 scale , they have a lot uncertainty about how happy they are with their living self .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of removing the dangers that others only get when they just put fire .
so we take something very complicated , we convert it into sound , we turn it into sounds , we produce something very complicated into the others .
and it turns out that if you can make something feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool for getting people to save more .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving the people we love to keep from fatal strikes , but also prepare them to be very clear .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to point out and create change for the very first time ?
i told my wife , whenever a human being used the contradiction because in a moral legal law , we should try to replace it with the words although .
i love every opportunity to find another colorful , crazy outfit , and also to photograph and also photograph and blog recently .
and every year , we ask the students to create products and services that , within a decade can contain the lives of billions of people within a decade .
they didn &apos;t count because it had remained with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had gotten to keep .
i think that molecular biology in general now , which is very generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have realized that the moral pendulum of the universe is far exvibrating , but it increases justice .
one process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do anything -- so in other words , everyone here -- doesn &apos;t always keep reasonable .
and something interesting about this , because what i was fascinated by jacques cousteout of shows , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
and finally , saturday : developing a own unique , personal style is a great way of telling the world a little bit about you without having to say a word .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult met me , she turned into a box full of ashes and was put into my hands .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might usually require 100,000 years , and we can compress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
his job is to create the conditions that existed for less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and up to 600 million times in a second .
that is , we first project our vision before we see it , put it back into our seatus back into our seatus to say , okay .
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to engage a compromise with the ideas in your head .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s all about creating a life of possibilities .
so one organism , for example , could learn not eat a particular fruit because it tasted bad and made it sick that last time he eaten it .
i mean , it may sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they haven &apos;t been born with this idea ; they &apos;ve developed it .
the reason that i felt worse with all these possibilities available , my expectations for what made for a good few jeans went up .
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been kind of like the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years about photovoltaics .
but they also preserve a secret to our future , a future in which we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and printed cooperation .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything for yourself , and most importantly , if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months behind the lake .
what they proved back was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it through another one that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us was measurable .
and i was amazed to resistance , resistance to what is at the end of the most effective thing in public health care in human history .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency we talked to recommended their customers to let the fingers of it .
but the measuring bar hit quite nicely , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t preliminary to do that yet .
so what for these reactors was a problem , what we &apos;re filling in our , and that &apos;s going to dramatically reduced waste volume during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code to a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
but this holds me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night . we never needed scientific progress as now , never .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
it seems that we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but in fact , most of all , the fundamental mechanisms are pretty much the same .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who receive taxes and performance .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert again if i can have the experience of experiencing the piece that i &apos;ve been working for so long as i &apos;ve reexperience .
but the logic of deception allows us to pretend the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong , as if , of course , you have to take the opposite without evidence .
well , there are playly brands and eight height brands , these things that come and go , but one was played , eight-fold brand is a pretty strong thing .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- think of a column -- that bury them without all the complexities .
and sometimes a little prototype of that experience is all it takes to get us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; to a ta-da moment .
so one day , i decided to visit the branch eggs , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we get into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have done that .
the head of congress came up onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of disease burden and 1.3 percent of health care employees .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world we live in , this interactive world belongs to us .
so i stood back there with a little team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar with a new technique that had not been around before .
we &apos;re going to turn on it , and we &apos;re going to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
how to increase happiness is very different dependent on how you think , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the life self .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you like this . &quot;
and then we have this is not compound , but that &apos;s yes , i think , has been doing relatively well , people are right convinced of like this .
so , that really hurt my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and then on a cloudy day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke in , and i said maybe again .
and even though the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it certainly has been your experience of the football game of your child is very different than it would have been .
and you know what ? when i say that , people shell at me and say , &quot; what cares ? do you ? do what do you want .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea about it , and they also no chance of forming it really well .
so , so , if you wanted to win a formula one , then you would take their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
of course , the problem is that , as well as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start to question , why do we sustain certain separations ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , it &apos;s about to present here , then we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation of society or the social form of society .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very noisy music and see if the livestock is skin ? &quot;
i know , and i &apos;m quite sure they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
that is , from the local village , actually become a global village with the same principles , as of course , intuitive , but also total transparency .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing not to be there , right ?
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as full of pin , if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from .
so i went to buy new jeans after many years of the old &apos;s wear , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
you have to separate two things : one is the medical fact of being amputated , and one thing , is the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
what &apos;s incredible to me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback from , or where i succeeded , are the ones where i interacted with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine the creation , because , if you think about the creation all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that make up the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
and this is how time is actually the critical variable that is a memory self from a living self , and time has very little impact on this story .
it was always proven to me and over again , when people came up to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s the way that &apos;s way that , people make mistakes of time to time .
and as you can see , this is a very intact area , and you had to kind of navigate there to get from island to get food .
they were just told that be the one-students , and those the students are sufficient , and in the same way , they taught them something and treated them .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like these plant here .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor and share it with others , for example , for a little over 100 dollars .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to variate the individual components and therefore ask some of these fundamental questions .
and now from this soul , you think that somehow you &apos;re in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , anima , it &apos;s called in latin , which is lufthalso .
nowadays , for the first time -- and the obama &apos;s campaign showed this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
instead of it &apos;s just quiet there , vibrated . the way it vibrated was about the way this -- like an extensive and joining bubble .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york , and remember , it &apos;s worth thousands of dollars is worth thousands of dollars .
and if you tell the people who , if you talk to the people , if you say that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , they get clever and hostile .
i was so lacked self-confidence that i asked the nurse who was taking care of what was taking a woman was doing printers , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when she goes home ? &quot;
osit osit itself is about 50 to seven thousand times of us ever on activity , so in your sleep , so in your sleep , they &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often punished than it is on day .
so every morning , i jump to my wall waage , and people already talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , just a little lettuce today , lucia . &quot;
we all know that interactive media by definition is nonlinear , involves the sensitivity of linearity , and what tells us , of course , is that we feel the linearity today .
once the first one is done , when it &apos;s promising , it &apos;s all very clear , because economic density , energy density is as different from nuclear energy as we know it .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fonds had a submission in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
they &apos;re not too late to start it to see if they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that use the vocal chords right .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to have in your view that any people around any consos are frozen around some console , or that they &apos;re playing with some console in your hand .
it was like time was going to stand still and the dancer was entering through a kind of pform . he did nothing but he ever done before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything was all assembled .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other autotypes , through new ways of the house , there are a lot of services where some services of energy are going down by 90 percent .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to recruit my little friend here and see , what does that mean from cognitive gonomy , when is that really intuitive ?
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people of been touched like this -- except for the pocahontas-story , why were they so touched by the world ?
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan winston , who was the best make-up and creature designer at that time was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
but one particular fellow , a man named erik obama ober , noticed something else , and that was that residents were scrapping the sidewalks free in front of those parts .
they went away from explanations of supernatural way , and they proven things like an overnatural concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very vague conceptual of birth .
except , you &apos;re very about to front of a cost-breakthrough and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
so when i look around this room and i see people who have either achieved a remarkable success already , or are there on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
this year , we celebrate the 200 birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed out to something very true in the human character .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours studying the tired study of any subject to the 21st year of life , we &apos;ll master in it .
we should use the effectiveness to get reduction , the less we emitate , the less we reitate , the lower the carbon sum will be and therefore the temperature will be too .
one interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data like shaking colors the way you do it with fluids .
what &apos;s going on is obvious that money doesn &apos;t get an experience happiness , but that lack of money , but that certainly lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in this case , we &apos;ve configures as color pots , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re being mixed .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for life , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self deciding self that decides how happy people are .
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
do you realize that we can take out of this and recharge the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetics ?
without her husband &apos;s support , she cared for a conversation by bringing him in the court and getting a ctor in her own case , and a even bigger conversation than she won .
i want you to imagine something now , a wearable robot that gives you overhuman capabilities , or another one that helps wheelchair drivers to stand up and go up again .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account were 14.9 million u.s. dollars when it was frozen .
the terrapower-concept means that instead of having a part of the uranium , one percent , u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , u238 .
if the stupid divine genius that you have to side , for a short moment , to show a brike of miracle through your effort , then sophiolé ! sophiolé !
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can constract the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
and so you get an idea that if you search information in this way , targets , broader , zoom in , zoom out , zoom out , you don &apos;t just want or surft .
you know , we really have -- moderate goals like the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry , right . if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? to become a main source of energy to become .
the droper actively actively actively on the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , even when the particular program that tries to infect it tries to go on that destination .
but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all the genres , seem to have this reputation , to be mentally imstable .
it &apos;s still associated with the earlier stories , because of his earlier stories , because of his earlier stories , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now making the research argument now .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues , i knew that an orthopedic in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then believe me i had problems looking in his eyes .
work -- we &apos;re blessed how carl pointed , with technology that allows us to work from every minute from every place on the planet every day on the planet every day -- to randolph hotel .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , that need to overlay with other 50-letter pieces to build smaller sub-units so that they fit .
it can create a thousand liters of clean water per day from different sources -- whether it saltwater , polluted water , latrines -- and all of this for less than two cents a liter .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo , which &apos;s an italo american whose name , as you can &apos;t speak correctly , so he &apos;s always called dr. p.
so i was asked by the president of honduras president of honduras , who said that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way to bring our country forward .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater , two percent is burst , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
usability always means , how can i get a certain goal very quickly , or how can a user be able to make effective , efficient and satisfying get a goal ?
it started out with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public places as part of architecture in public places .
here in the picture on the upper left , you see biocurious , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit facility where everyone can go .
now the transition place is where these communities are so close to return , that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into a record chain on dna .
but the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day , the cup that we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
so they either survived together , or they went down together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and preferred by evolution .
this is the greatest time ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you scale you scale on : health , wealth , mobility , mobility , setting disease .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of medium of multiple scales .
and to be honest , the only real and remaining disability that i had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying it could describe me with these definitions .
now , of course , in a way , such accidents are recows the value of science and engineering to those limits . it &apos;s easy to reject that kind of thing .
now you might think that the problem was looking at people who certainly when they lived in predator societies , killed animals that were only after a few generations of what they had done .
the little thing that we added up was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
and when that air hall poiss over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can live only , yes with soul .
so today , i want to take you today , in a way , on a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere , to try and understand what &apos;s actually gone lost .
and then when we go back into the realm of software , here &apos;s the first command line interfaces that were very abstract where you took months to deal with these systems .
the coolest thing about this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there will give this april , moca in the inner city of los angeles , will be an exhibition called the art of the streets . &quot;
this year , for the first time , you were able to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india , to 50 percent of the same electricity -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are going back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , become part of our own children become part of the geography of hope .
kids , old , all sorts of people go there to just deal with it , they set up a lab , and they look at what can you do when these lab protocols are in .
tastemaker , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and where the audience determines popular .
if you may only believe that you &apos;re a body -- of an unimaginable source of your life passed on to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
so somehow , i have to find from now to keep a way to preserve a safe distance between me and my very natural hescalation about what the response will be .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t listen to sioux than they were arc and arrow tasks when the americans stopped being americans than they were doing horse and horses .
she made me realize this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatars and put your consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
there &apos;s no boundary for technology and design that allows us to be human , even as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , limitation and injustice .
and even though you &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re going to support our child mutilating a football game , we &apos;re also wondering , &quot; should i take this call ?
so i came with the need to just expose a check , and instead i put out a check that i didn &apos;t know the slightest idea how to solve it .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business map , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in this room , and it &apos;s right here .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a fish . i don &apos;t like it up . i don &apos;t like it very much .
but it &apos;s this contempt that makes this thing that we own , and for which we pay for , makes something that works against us , something else , and then we took ourselves .
and i &apos;ll keep music with nathaniel over again , whether it &apos;s in walt disney hall or skid row , because it reminds me why i became a musician .
the beauty is that , on this island , on this island , you can actually take everything that can take away on problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to settle in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
telephones , computers , video fruits , cd roms , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to be able to have this information .
maybe the concept that &apos;s the concept right now that &apos;s just paying attention to what &apos;s broken in a , and how we repair that , is a greater disability for each and pathology in itself .
and the third one is concentrational illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a circumstances that affects well-being without distorting its meaning .
we hire games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need from the games .
if we don &apos;t treat a human anothful one , and we don &apos;t perceive all its forces and options , we &apos;re also creating to the natural struggle they might have to lead , another disease .
there are also some nice ways in education as languages , mathematics or logic games , where we want to give people the possibility of fast trial and see the results immediately .
the distinction between the happiness of living self and the satisfaction of remembering self has been detected over the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what causes us to feel real .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to do an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and you see an animation of elds in front of the house .
and there was another nurse said , not the sister who &apos;d seen for the woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most emergency doctors i know about .
now , there are deposits , whether you learn it for the use , only passively understands or you can talk actively , to the musical native language .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be full-time researcher for a while . &quot;
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
they &apos;re nothing but something you put in the morning , and it gives them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase their speed further , and that will help them maintain their balance .
every dollar was given and was put into further education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to pay for , and most of the time , these were the new things , they were always coming out of a second hand .
this was dr. kean , a man i only knew from my mother &apos;s narratives on that day , because , of course , i came too late two weeks to my birthday .
the average of them is about 50 inches , bwl students are creating half of them , lawyers a little bit more , but not much , child kindergarten children are better than the adults .
when in an environment where the adults make music actively , or at least active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flower have ?
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we &apos;re doing democracy about anatomy -- to think about the individual body in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality as it is saving in online games .
now , the exact correlation between a co2 increase , and the result of temperature change and where their other consequences are , there are some ambiguity , but not very many .
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , &quot; because they have common , also bisexual sex , with changing partners , and rules of so conflicts and social angels .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of where , adding thousands of characteristics every time in just one second to one species every time in just one second to a species every time .
so the people who decided to participate were more likely to participate in , the more opportunities they were able to them , the more they rent it actia and the fonds .
that means , eyet , if you know this now , look at who you &apos;re looking at for as long , because i &apos;m not taking a election for what can just happen according to .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and we put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
so , very exciting processes that then is not really happening in this one , yes , but it &apos;s actually not really happening here in this rogentle mass that just corresponding .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back-up system , or a system , that can only store in small quantities here .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to be evil , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first hot part in the here .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as is particularly impressive to itself is that we have anchored in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
and part of me wondered , what if the content of a personality was something that would be machine readable in the future -- could be made visible by fmri ?
we need to deal with the unstoppable separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we &apos;re all singing , dance and produce art .
that means , if we look at that we can transmit existing models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a designers .
i said , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollution the environment . &quot;
so these communities started to evolve , so that the level in which evolution happened was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
if you see who we were and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives would have come into our lives .
now , after i chosen government , i realize that the wikipediacatories , most cover time magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot;
now , if we &apos;re able to compress the systems that control of the filrists and valves , then we can actually get a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
but then this could only be a 3d cloud of image points that you can go into and through which you can go through , that you can look at from many , many directions .
and my friends who make great , huge hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and we bent around the corner , and we had the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of paintbrush flamingos , a literally pink carpet as far as the eye is enough .
so crazy as crazy as this may sound in the context of my talk , that &apos;s physically moving into not existential , virtual worlds , all after the model of the holodeck .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question i &apos;ve dedicated my work at the institute over the future over the future over the future over years .
we can watch our kids play football , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and we can have our blackberry on other hip , and we can probably have our laptop on our lap .
. do i understand you right ? your software enabled that at a certain point , all the pictures used by someone in the world are basically linked together ?
and i have the impression that when we make vacations , that &apos;s very often the case , that means we make vacations extensively in the service of the memory self .
and it wasn &apos;t until he turned 19 that he got enough medical problems , actually from that , because he was internally struck that the doctors found that he was female inside .
18 months ago , i did something else on google , and i talked about doing something with museums and art , and my head , which is today , gave me a green light .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as the work that came after the work that came after the success of my last book , right ?
but i bet playing with the ground wave taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just let you pass by , and they remain at one place .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and in different types of research -- that you can just apply in your business .
so if we think more about things like this , then people &apos;s obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter me because i &apos;m a good citizen .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vibrate and not vibrate -- something that is allowed only in quantum mechanics .
how big would you have to be such a battery like this to get an island like this to 20 , 30 , 50 , 50 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewables .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all , because you might make you lazy , so you eat , because you know your heart surgery is going to save you .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , studying why we &apos;re better at real life than we &apos;re in real life .
play is a shapeer , and it can adopt a lot of shapes , some of which is a little bit quiet , curious -- perhaps to discover the amazing one again .
so here we have a whole way of parallel education , where young people learn the same way , which it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and the reason for this would be , first of all , we succeeded to get a lot of genes that would otherwise have been selected out and be removed from the population .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , i put the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40-years as a chemist who was asked if he could be afraid to be a chemist .
that doesn &apos;t mean that then you can probably go home four hours more , but your employer or someone already comes up with the four hours .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections to all the things around you , define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
