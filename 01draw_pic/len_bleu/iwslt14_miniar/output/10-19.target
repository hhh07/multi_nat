my grandmother never let me forget his life .
and let me show you a simple example .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
which is great , because we need that .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
let me show you how they work .
so just imagine that for a moment .
just spread it as wide as possible .
can you play it in blue now ?
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
raise your hands . let me see .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
let me give you good close look at this .
this is something that has to get to zero .
and in that time you can react differently .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
their problem is that they have too little .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
everything that &apos;s inside can be utilized .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
they were exactly like the people in this room .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
and that generally looks like this .
my mother phoned minutes later .
so give me a hand here .
that means something built in a city .
and the problem is not technology itself .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
and actually i become a character in the book .
how about living longer with good health ?
and in this mind they had memory .
and how does it look in there ?
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
in those countries where people have money .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
the only thing they had was their mind .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
he &apos;s only deceiving you and not himself .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
i learned that it all changes in an instant .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
here are the results we just obtained .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
well , i think number one is curiosity .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
the responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
we would never do that in our own countries .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
we had to take them out , which we did .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
what we want to do is make the future .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
think about this : this attack is generic .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
this is another look at the tree of life .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
the first is that we will not evolve .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
and these women would get together and just talk .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and the third area speaks for itself really .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
you zoom in . you really go in .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
but what this image represents was the problem .
i can claim anything .
i can claim anything .
imagine then just two other little changes .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would opt for memory ?
so please listen when music is played .
so go ahead and start inventing .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
so you could feel good about selling it .
we can take a look at that now .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
that it comes to the human from outside .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
the second factor is the services we use .
so ants weigh more than we do .
you look around at all these museums here .
how much money does it take to do this ?
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
if you have something to give , give it now .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bomb .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please blow up . &quot;
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to briefly mention a project .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire brigade , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
but will we make the most of our playfulness ?
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
that really is very important , that we get there .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
but settling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
and we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
it was , &quot; in perpetuity . forever . &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
but you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
you are virtualising the reality without a computer .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
it &apos;s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
but combined , they can create something like this .
not a movie , not hd -- for real .
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
it was called the automatic binding brick .
that &apos;s a funny occurrence , you know .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
repower america . it &apos;s time to get real .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
the disaster is for that two billion .
you know , you can choose your list .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
and of course how design affects perception .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
ok , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
however there is a political battle in our country .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
but we know very little about where things go .
just like it used to happen in the village .
i know what people think when they see this .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
that &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
a friend of mine did that -- richard bollingbroke .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
and then we tried out a whole load of simulations .
there &apos;s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
i know of some people who haven &apos;t registered .
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the eighties .
hey , puma , do you are you really serious ?
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
so , i say : let the world-changing games begin .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and &quot; ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
france scores . italy scores .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
it &apos;s a type of territorial behavior , right ?
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
we &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can twist that around .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is &quot; the starry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
i &apos;ll be revealing what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
a all the beautiful things in life are inefficient .
there weren &apos;t christmas trees . we made it all .
i play to explain what these tones might have meant .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system sucks .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
well there are opportunities all around us .
these things are logically correct .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
they did it by draining the land .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
and i started to think i should just dump this project .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &quot;
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
and other another example are the ambient , intelligent systems .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s deceived you .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
so i wear two hats in most of what i do .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
we think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
but our perception , how it deceives us too .
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the suspense .
and then we started negotiating with the islanders .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
&quot; 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak .
the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and the doc says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s unfair .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and also anything they would conjure up in their minds today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
only i think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
that &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
it &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
the fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-choices of course .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
and i &apos;m bawling , i &apos;m crying , like a little kid .
in holland we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and the more candidly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
and i saw mrs. drucker , and she was breathless .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chancellor is a man .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
you know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of eden .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
we &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those additions .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
an anecdote you might know talks about this time .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t settle .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
societal decay . 65 dead .
new investments to create high-paying jobs .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
when you look at the people you deal with ..
so it &apos;s about effectivity , not efficiency .
and they did this using so-called lead maps .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
well let me work up some blood for you .
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
he invited over to dinner the king of siam .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
so when klaus says , there is no soul .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
in my warped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
and they are just the biohackers , individuals .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
and that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
a playful , mindful brand . what is your brand ?
he said , &quot; we farm extensively , not intensively .
it &apos;s an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
they live lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and she asked him , so what are your hobbies ?
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
but where would be the nearest aed to help this patient ?
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
so the awards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground .
so the question is , how should we deal with nappies ?
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health .
we &apos;re making androgen , and we &apos;re responding to androgens .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
a young lad like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fires .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
i &apos;d like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
i &apos;m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there &apos;s some magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
let &apos;s call him miguel -- actually his name is miguel .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
i was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
because it doesn &apos;t know which haystack it should go to first .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
and as a general term , we can use the term intersex for this .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
tempt &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
you practically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
so how do we operationalize the question of content of character ?
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
and we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
as the one hat , i do history of anatomy .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen actively ?
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials .
and you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
so beyond simple play , littlebits are actually pretty powerful .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concern of of biohackers .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire brigade .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the atlantic .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked .
at the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
halftime , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
that &apos;s high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
and now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chancellor is not a man .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
mark , mark , come back .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
this rule of three contains three theorems .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
you learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in bach &apos;s time .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fairer than you .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , i need you to go into the house .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct .

some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
so that &apos;s just one application among many that you can use .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm .
that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
so all of the green areas , these are your target-rich environments .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball ?
so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
and i love this : &quot; watson vanquishes human opponents . &quot;
so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be evermore possible .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
the consequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
so there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
i &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have .
and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and when i listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
by the end of march the lhc will be intact again .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absorb and release phosphorus .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .

so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .

one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
one big spoonful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
we &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
so i can drill into what i &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll .
aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still primarily at .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
you can only be climate neutral if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .

so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .

so that what they had only conjured up in their minds becomes listenable .
tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .

gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
then i took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that .
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s archaic . how can that be ? &quot;
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;

he asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the argentinians .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo &apos;s say it .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund .
as an interpreter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represented in south-east-asia .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &quot;
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?

and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classical music .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
they &apos;re pre-engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 &apos;s .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
vaclav havel , the great czech leader , talked about this .

i &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
that &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
i say , ulf , why do you need such a big car ?
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow .

underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; finfisher . &quot;
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .

anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .

this is &quot; the ambassadors , &quot; based in the national gallery .
now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .

in order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .

you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;

the second theorem is thus , if klaus is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
according to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ?
