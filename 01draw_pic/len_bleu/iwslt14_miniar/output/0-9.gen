hey , why not ?
good work ! yes !
that &apos;s super important .
the farm is incredible .
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s going on .
so what do you say ?
robert gupta .
what happened here ?
thank you very much .
sounds familiar , what ?
why no longer life ?
they have similar principles .
oh , that &apos;s one .
1,000 , very good .
this is our present .
that &apos;s the system .
you could see manhattan .
that was the result .
there &apos;s no normal one .
centers were built .
just do your job .
i &apos;m interested in that .
what happened here ?
lento , slowly .
yes , good day .
yes , good day .
very different term .
stand them .
what a fish .
in fact , that &apos;s me .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
wonderful , so ?
and she did .
they &apos;re all important .
completely inefficient .
that &apos;s efficient .
not very sustainable .
it &apos;s essential .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they meet al .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
what did they do ?
ban is blank .
i was amazed .
it &apos;s generic .
pretty good , right ?
a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he opens the door .
so they knew everything .
not guilt management .
how do we know ?
and i was an artist .
because you know what ?
yes , that &apos;s going .
we can do it differently .
so how does this work ?
let &apos;s call him don .
how are you interested in ?
what do these people need ?
can we change it ?
these days are over .
bg : thank you .
can i be honest ?
this is the last one .
you can go in .
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
that would have been okay .
i was thinking about it .
what is media today ?
so let &apos;s see .
here &apos;s an example .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re dragging . &quot;
i faced with him .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
and that &apos;s important .
but you know what ?
it has sensors .
we can do that .
what was the result ?
here &apos;s the video .
yes , milliseconds .
but you know what ?
rate it again .
that &apos;s very good .
all the environmental debate .
these people make money .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , i know .
i have a question .
i don &apos;t think so .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
that &apos;s a wish .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
flying cat flying cat .
why do we do that ?
they use their hands .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s terrible .
oh my god !
we lose them .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
we love entertainment .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s going .
does that sound good ?
a lot .
we &apos;re going to take off .
i can help .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
the only chance .
that was incredible .
long , yeah .
stephen watts .
the sun rises .
fantastic , right ?
yeah , in a way .
thank you .
no hospital either .
where ?
they need time .
we were poor .
thank you .
and he says ...
are all these ?
that &apos;s going fast .
that &apos;s not ...
one and a half million .
that &apos;s hard to do .
what does that mean ?
yeah . okay .
i &apos;m tom .
here it is .
that &apos;s us .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
music as a language .
from seattle ...
yes , hello .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s singing .
what does that mean ?
solar technology is ...
a few less .
we know that .
that &apos;s wrong .
we love innovation .
keep twice .
after a week .
it &apos;s interesting .
ta-da !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
woa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
come on .
60,000 .
pretty simple .
suck .
sustainable .
unique .
fine .
thank you .
thank you .
positive .
thank you .
it alone about that alone .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
one ?
can you do that ?
well , yeah .
that &apos;s true .
seriously .
that &apos;s going .
maybe not .
ol√© !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah .
yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
yeah !
thank you .
yes ?
why ?
okay .
yeah .
really .
yes ?
here &apos;s what .
yeah .
yes ?
okay .
creativity .
yes ?
no .
thank you .
yes ?
fantastic .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
yes ?
yes ?
wow !
it &apos;s about that .
thank you .
yes ?
thank you .
hello !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yes ?
my wife told me .
let &apos;s honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
again , here you have it again .
so what &apos;s what &apos;s hack now ?
and finally , epic significance .
this picture is from this place .
that was the beginning of the journey .
first extension , second .
you want to feed the world ?
she connected these two people .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
but it was very sad .
what is this thing ?
they could have done better .
and that &apos;s the crux .
but they do the job .
that &apos;s very risky .
does it make that curious ?
and how did that feel ?
and that worked very well .
so it works like this .
very frightening .
they both called me .
overlived technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming in .
the orange tractor .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but the key thing is , ...
what about fitness ?
the power plant can explode .
and then they set them up .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
what happened there ?
the one place is south korea .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
you really loved it .
same thing , just bigger .
well , i was the next one .
is that reasonable ?
i just loved two .
she &apos;s sharing their experience with others .
well , let &apos;s want .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it was a huge success .
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
the data was not available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
pattern recognition should work .
it was my first sunburn .
and there are hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
you can have that cloud .
it &apos;s not our burden .
because you can train that .
think about your own decisions .
so it &apos;s circle .
i wanted to support them .
sometimes i push too much .
and then everybody went down .
i had awe .
her mother raised her on her own .
it &apos;s kind of like that , you know .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
tell me about this world .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
that &apos;s such a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this is what happened at christmas .
okay , there are a few .
they saw the big deal .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plush .
who are these relatives ?
i want to ask you something .
we need to spread the message .
you can see that down there .
you also have to understand that .
why not think about it that way ?
what do i look at ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
his name is tempt .
but what do we do with it ?
you can see the water coming .
first of all , we have the population .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
... invent his own story .
is it about light ?
now , what does that mean ?
i was devastated .
this is pre-visual .
so what do you think happened now ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i had a good life .
the game is from 2007 .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
we &apos;re no longer producing ourselves .
i can claim everything .
what &apos;s the soul ?
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll end up now .
you can &apos;t have bones .
it may sound miserable .
we were 20 people .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
that &apos;s how many .
will it be my size ?
or is it possible ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
conflicts creativity emerges .
this is felix .
so what do we need to do ?
it would be knowledless .
and this opens up a map .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
most of you here know .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re constantly hitting each time .
that &apos;s kind of it .
there are online criminals .
i created one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no food .
people were playing insane .
but it gets worse .
it keeps you fresh .
he really liked it .
does anybody see something particular ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
good afternoon , all together .
and then it became international .
let me wrap up .
there &apos;s an old study .
and so it was like that .
he used to point out here .
that &apos;s a great question .
some people have come and left .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were remixes .
this is the city .
in china , it was different .
here &apos;s another example .
i agree with you completely .
dk : 60,000 .
luckily not , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
first of all , limited .
thank you .
why should we do that ?
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
i wonder .
thank you very much for listening .
they even hurt .
i swear it up .
i represent kids .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s against justice .
jk : both .
but what do your fish eat ?
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
place the camera out .
again , my gut feeling again .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
after just one journey there .
yeah . all right .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
here you see it .
it &apos;s a tremendous challenge .
the data came in .
what creates the illusion ?
don &apos;t be discouraged .
i don &apos;t think so much .
what would everything have to be done ?
it was still fish .
and a lot of people forget this .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
am i going to like the color ?
my name is amit .
privacy must be given .
ooh , thank you .
is that your opinion ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
they look like this .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is the short-term capture .
the work of interpreting .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
i think it &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we useful ?
so , what does that mean ?
let &apos;s also call him don well .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we actually work ?
i think it &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened years after that ?
i grew up in india .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
is it even photography ?
okay , a few more .
i mean the soul .
but there &apos;s something else .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
very expensive real estate .
yes , here it is .
and the answer to that is no .
and it got better .
just going on . it &apos;s great .
ohh .
crisis . death . disaster .
did you see these guys ?
i felt really good .
we have three main groups .
give pee a chance .
and i &apos;ve always had that .
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
you order comparison .
and why is that ?
he &apos;d had the experience .
it would be intolerable .
we &apos;ve lost contact .
that was what she did secretly .
okay . thank you very much .
this is what happens to us today .
so she was back .
oh . wait .
what do you want to do ?
i want to tell you .
or before bombs .
we need energy miracles .
why is this happening at all ?
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two options .
but i continued to work .
not toxic in there .
you see it immediately .
and i continued to work .
what about longevity ?
the game begins -- silence .
do you want to make suck jeans ?
it &apos;s like talking .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
so i just started playing .
this is not how you can do something out of nothing .
but it &apos;s not documented .
so you can &apos;t solve it at all .
and this video is real time .
i like things that are different .
and that &apos;s at the beginning .
it really changed the dynamic .
i went to jail -- hard .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
they sell certificates .
the truth is more like this .
because for me , it means memory .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them before .
and then we said , okay .
it spreads rapidly .
how and what did he feel ?
it can know where we are .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
we say sustainability in germany .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
this is a picture of the object .
do you know what &apos;s envy ?
but we need it all .
that sounds frightening .
hmmm , my brand ?
this is frightening .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next : nuclear energy .
let &apos;s keep that quiet .
but fully effective , right ?
it &apos;s completely trivial .
thank you very much for your patience .
what else &apos;s risky ?
now , i was trying something exciting .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
her family gathered .
i remember my first fire .
i fell in love with this fish .
dark urine . dark .
nullemissions , right ?
what is a story like ?
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
the motivations to write it .
i shoot something through my head .
so , look what happens .
anyway , not to navigate .
why did i go to medicine ?
otherwise , they can &apos;t have teeth .
all adults were aware of the risks .
have you ever been discriminate ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
so the correlation is low .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
it turns out to be really hard to do .
how far do you get there ?
and these are the neural structures .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
anyway , we need a solution .
if you get to that , right ?
you can do it all the time .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
so we measured his movement .
and that can make a lot of difference .
but the truth is far from that .
it seemed to be quite popular .
on the book and on the picture .
you can see something fun here .
that &apos;s what i stop , thank you very much .
that &apos;s just the minimum right now .
that doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
they flooded the channels .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
five million people use it every month .
but it requires a lot of planning .
it makes leukemia in kids .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
okay , you really want to know that ?
now i see greg lemoon .
we can regain our nutrients .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
that has to be the difference of aging .
i &apos;m not taking the same line .
you can show , i was there .
they haven &apos;t given up government .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s deceptive .
do we really want to go that way ?
they had been genetically expressed .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
he can only use his eyes .
they &apos;re going to be irresistible .
so the first step to an interpretation .
in adopting maybe two percent .
we started this 15 years ago .
lego made it possible for everyone .
and there are several reasons for this .
i really like beautiful clothes .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because we live on a water planet .
privacy is not the debate .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
this picture reminded me of something .
baseball is full of great statistics .
oh , my time is already over ?
something went up inside of me .
i could draw . i could paint .
i really wanted to work normal at the time .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
we can &apos;t just do that .
once the judge saw me .
so i went to the court .
i got some scared of technology .
they create an epic story .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and there &apos;s good news .
my name is brian goldman .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the story is not over yet .
but there are two problems with this .
and it was an incredible experience .
so it &apos;s not like detox .
no one has ever said that before .
the whole building was made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
what should our testimony look like ?
but , but you know what ?
they can play with different ways .
is this all just education ?
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
they basically do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other brands are like this ?
the white lines are for the population .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child &apos;s games .
and that &apos;s what we did .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
and then something weird happened .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible aties .
they have so much uncertainty .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
that was great .
the data is showing this all the time .
for example , this perception in the context .
that made me really sad .
they always say , why ?
what happened that day ?
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
people were still happy .
so let me remind you .
they come from the artists .
she was back and she was dying .
now , how did this happen ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
but that &apos;s not going to go that fast .
this is a game for outside .
i learned everything memorized .
does anybody know what that is ?
he also showed him jafour .
and we take it all up .
so that &apos;s the good news .
2.5 to one , great .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
she did it for three years .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so they saw something magical .
play is not silly .
and i said , &quot; of course .
he actually collected fish .
no had never been an opportunity .
so , we can .
how can we help you ? &quot;
further than that we don &apos;t go .
once we started a vivid .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
they become the computer in the open computer .
because does anybody have masses here ?
every waste is nutrients .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re too many .
this one has the greatest impact .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and the shape plays a role .
slowly but safe it turned to be .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and then i can transmit the whole thing .
what lessons have we learned ?
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
this is all metadata .
and it starts with a doctor .
they &apos;re getting more and more like them .
i &apos;m going to tell you something to you .
because i can say anything .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
i asked the nurse on a lot of time .
creativity had to look out somehow .
today , everything &apos;s easy to have .
an autistic student .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
take nothing but granted .
and that was 19 years ago .
doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
italy winning . yeah .
but i &apos;m not buying anything new .
let &apos;s be othuck . &quot;
it &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
so paul is a terrorist .
which one would you like most ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
i never cook with it .
the morning before the game .
i started to feel better .
they &apos;re all important possibilities . &quot;
so this is one of the images .
we went to an area .
and here &apos;s the representation .
we depend on two countries .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
it just doesn &apos;t work technological .
he pointed at the algae .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and then realizing it .
below that , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
and you already have a problem .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
so the question is : how ?
so men can &apos;t be pigs with that .
look at what she does .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe in that .
but with the right design , there we go .
how would you describe your brand ?
we can support them to be good .
something very strange is happening here .
i &apos;m a speaker person .
what are these three billion people bring along ?
we also got very accurate data .
it was really , really profound .
they &apos;re all picking questions .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system in which we live in .
we can support them to be good .
and women argued it succeed .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
you should want some .
even cats are looking at this video .
the roof was also covered with water .
this is a painting of a circle .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
but i continued to ask these questions .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
you can see away from the back to the front of the first time .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
he moved back to silence .
especially if he &apos;s already died .
it &apos;s been defeated constant so far .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so scott gets this fruit .
politely , everybody applaud .
now look at this curve .
so i followed my gut feeling .
they &apos;ve literally laid down the lever .
maybe put some mutations .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
adversity are just part of our lives .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked till late at night .
they have them . they always have them .
the byproduct is clean water .
we need to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
it turns off the power plants .
it might take a while to be invited .
i &apos;m going to read you the entry .
there was jimmy kimmy kimdrum .
so from modern society to computer society .
and the curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
we talk ambiguous about it .
we go through initiation rituals .
it &apos;s about resupply of america .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the mechanism is from the lie .
the main man would wave me up .
a dalmatiner , right .
no , that was what i thought .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
and also , these sources are interruptions .
no , no , it &apos;s missing .
the chef had cooked it .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is such a commissioned part .
the shore is from another place .
we now have masses in this country .
they can be logical and intuitive .
i lived in parallel worlds .
and that was the outbreak of thing .
so the first excitute primate .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
maybe i did it with good reason .
not even the truth will free it .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
maybe we need to take a look beyond that .
these kinds of states don &apos;t exist for us .
we can give ourselves something like this .
156 nations are sending our television channel .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
we live in a really extraordinary time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and even lomborg thinks about .
the dose also plays a role .
everybody &apos;d like to make people happier .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
to say , what &apos;s information ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things .
you put a box like this .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
we talk about audacious , fresh .
he was shaking his head , no .
i thought everyone could do that .
but today we &apos;re way beyond that .
they tap on their internet connection .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
this is going to take place in the next april .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
they &apos;re the homecountries of someone .
what takes five thousand seconds to take ?
i see the dalmatiner .
so that &apos;s the reason this project .
tempt today is completely paralyzed today .
so ... so doesn &apos;t mean so optimistic .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
this is an ecological network .
does anybody even know what that is ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , what &apos;s going to work ?
and i &apos;d like to read those to you .
and there are collaborators .
make it possible -- all of you here .
that &apos;s just been represented .
so there &apos;s feedback .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and why ? it genetically changed food .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
so littlebit is open source .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
so this is a tough nt .
tell what you feel .
it &apos;s completely focused on a particular goal .
he died , broken through the story .
this is how the building works .
you always lose rare animals .
they interrupted each other .
it will touch her deeply .
they kept us being inspired .
i represent people into death cells .
that i &apos;d written these crazy things .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
let &apos;s start perceiving .
now we saw the reverse effect .
so there are two cycles coming out .
we &apos;ve embedded unique elements here .
this sounds , basically the first time unusual .
i hope you forgive me .
are you doing that for the kids ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
the rocks are color coded .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
a billion people are going to starve today .

i &apos;m going to shoot my sleeve back .
it &apos;s about inhale .
our magazines are read by millions .
it &apos;s about changing adaptive values .
a has these benefits and risks .
we need to think about what brands .
my brother staring at me .
who do you actually want to inform with this ?
we can reinvent everything again .
bjstockn sundin .
it &apos;s going to come very simple , that &apos;s going to come .
risk is not a simple game .
and that &apos;s how confused me like this ...
they even bring in funding .
and then a lot in the third , they forgotten again .
here &apos;s the olive oil aiss .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but then they really want to go deep inside .
the defeat would have been too simple .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
here he &apos;s going to let the sun go up .
who would ever wish one ?
and i jump on it every morning .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
he was sixty already .
that was more for emphasis .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
it was a pretty fateful project .
this is the storage basins .
and this sounds very different than it did before .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
no , i mean it really serious .
and the goal here is quite simple .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
and i had to go out of the city .
here &apos;s your brand aisle .
her father died shortly after her birth .
i started with my usual talk .
they want to orient in the museum ?
so this crazy story could be true .

i hold the knife in my hand .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
happy productivity . fantastic !
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
and everyone in this room has to go in .

the result of that was catastrophic .
they add up very well .
i tried to understand them .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
i could think of energy .
and that &apos;s where you feel it already .
students are divided to notes .
these things are logically correct .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
he &apos;s interested in fire .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate .
these are the apsaras .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
who could have looked like this ?

we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .

but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i started an institute to do that .
so that &apos;s how nature are presented .
this may be transmitted publicly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
i call this the bright tiger .

i think there are opportunities everywhere .
longer than those other two networks .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
these are called project carrier today .
the movie hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
automatically , it walks the right thought .

we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re originally .
and the two latest ones are here today .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
but reality is always unpredictable .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
the official dogma of what ?
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
we &apos;re talking about drowning into information .
i tried to preserve the body .
we forced them . puff them .
it captures trash a thousand square kilometers .

they laughed more than you do here .
you can come in for a particular year .
we reject genetically engineered food .

maybe we can see adversity as change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
we &apos;re now thinking about energy scarcity .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
so , this really blew my mind .
people suffered . people were fighting .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
that &apos;s more like the norm to do it .
what ? that really let me freak out .
you go around and you amuse .
restore america . find more out more .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;

three : escalation of expectations .

now you see the dalmatiner .
my fourth technology : requirement for complexity .
i thought i could integrate myself .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so again , this was fit really well .
and if you don &apos;t , yet you dance your dance .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
so that made sense , it fit together .
you &apos;re hoping we don &apos;t need that .
and this is a million company .
then he whispered me to the ear .
motors , gears -- four options .
and this is very important in medical research .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
eeee ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
yet , we seem to be all satisfied with it .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
there &apos;s a lot of happy coaching .
there can be a sequence of changes .
we need to use more research funds .
and here &apos;s each piece is very well planned .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
this is alfred gonzalez .
