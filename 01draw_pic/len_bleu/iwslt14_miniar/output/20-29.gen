we can get them to do things that they thought couldn &apos;t .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that something was going on there .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with the people .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does under the axes .
people are recognizing that they should think about happiness if they think about politics .
and this is what led us thinking about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
then they only use what &apos;s there on the sun and wind where they live .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient from suffering , but just a little bit and much less than they did before .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , their actions are quite natural .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky , and i tried it .
and what it does is it makes people to walk into business and ask that question .
i think the genius , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i ask , can you sing , can &apos;t you sing , a because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
and so the movie will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
in good like evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions will be on us .
yes , you feel it already when you &apos;re hotter at that point . there &apos;s something &apos;s wrong .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this is that government is not the same as politics .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone here today is this idea for you completely okay for you ?
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they care for their lives .
all you have to say is &quot; creates words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
now , extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important already , and much , much more important in the future .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
and then all of a sudden you would see what it would not speak if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , of course , never comes .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
think about that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
what i always have to say to myself when i get crazy about it is , don &apos;t be afraid .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really blew me out of the socks .
now we know from that study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
let &apos;s take a look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can anticipate development .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
we need to prevent people from getting knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and so by the way , it &apos;s been around 500 years , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that mics us is our imagination .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i &apos;m hoping most of you have heard about before .
and like many people , i thought the government was mostly about choosing people into an office .
this is a whole range of things that you think of besides actual existence as a creator .
take ways that are easy to use and start with these , to hug patients on the team .
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and so in the interest in this technology , i just continued to go in there .
so the reason that i &apos;m all about this is that when you see something that &apos;s impossible , it makes it possible .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just so architecture almost disappears .
and what we can now read it almost every day in the daily newspaper , you &apos;ll find that third sentence .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise it doesn &apos;t have .
or are we meant to be something else -- something that may be even better adapted to the environment ?
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we &apos;re all fighting , which is who can talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
because obviously , an animal that was very often in it gets rarely before it dies .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing great games together to survive another century on this planet .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and i &apos;d like to please you to protocol , that i was here for my part of the job .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
but these articles were worried about me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that less is today .
the only thing i did is changed the order in which this information is presented .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think that the fish knows something .
i thought , &quot; put the camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a back conversation .
and in reality , when we fail , when we bump on obstacles , we often feel different .
for them , life had asked their a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
and so you see animals that are called right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i want to know your answers .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no deprivation in their treatment either .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations who are building a new life together .
we &apos;ve arrived at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as we used to .
just to give you the overview , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this will happen in the way this .
now look at what happened that day , just in observe the activity that happens in the network .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another &apos;s life until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and like someone deal with it , are two different things .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard of before will join global communications .
we want to preserve things that have disappeared , or things that are no longer the way they were .
it was a way that parents can figure out what are the right public schools for their children .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not on .
is this something you can share with us , because now you have a few minutes left ?
so we thought that we could start to write a whole new chapter in mobility .
you &apos;ve probably heard about level to the level to and + one strength , or + one intelligence .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than that allow the normal ways to produce .
no , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , to citizens .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types who are asking social norms .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so i started thinking about what it is , what these games make masters master us master .
if you turn on the light on , it looks like this . so the same way we saw it before .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned so many times .
all of these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
and then if you take good recordings , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
we push , for example , to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
so many people right now have in the world who spend at least one hour an hour with online games .
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
you &apos;ve got to go up , you &apos;ve got to get this woman , and you have to get this woman a couple of shoes . &quot;
and listen , everybody has a right to their mind , even a right to progress &apos;s opinion .
when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
in fact , we thought this was the end here , but we tried to get the process a little further .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
if you have 10 teams that typical , you get about six structures that have stable structures .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time has missed a lot of biology .
they live in a world that has information and communications , as no one could have predicted .
i tried to make clear how valuable cities are , to value how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , granny . i promise it . &quot;
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of adversity , a perception of the icon , is a sense of our own power .
today , we want to talk about how video becomes vial , and then finally why this is important .
never making a mistake , but nobody &apos;s thinking about the details of how this should be done .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to do , because it urges people to work very quickly .
there are very , very few things you can even say about , of which there is a chance in a million .
so this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so the achievement of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , adding myself , adding myself at the same time .
so the idea is that we actually bring together the people involved where they put things together , collectively do .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all of these pictures , you can set up your own collection .
because the ground is that mosses will die off , and the wind and the water washing away .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you dropped it somewhere .
so , as citizens , you &apos;re being able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
it &apos;s how happy or happy the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in the here and now .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process when you push on the trigger .
and yes , the discussion is all about the question , how far can you take away a piece of the future there ?
and every time it divided , the chemicals that found have been distributed to the same amounts of it .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger is expressed .
and the result is , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m refused to the adication .
but not only that -- that merge and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever did .
yet , my interest in photography when i got my first digital camera , started at the age of 15 .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re being taken by the mind . how can you be harmed ?
so he says this actually makes sense , because players can do more online worlds than in real life in online .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to its level of the game , right ?
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you also have to be able to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them around , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to go .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following one .
but the challenge is to try and figure out which they are and why we keep them , and do they make sense ?
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s probably determined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles away from the next ocean .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
some of you may have heard about this that i turned on an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
maybe you can stand up for a second so that they can talk at recess with both the project .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are , or how big the pictures are .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this in itself can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s so stuck in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
all , i suddenly realize that appearance is increasingly unimportant to success , just the usability is going to become a app .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it away now .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in california are they not going to get the correct answer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what genetic code is going to look like .
and then when i come there with my little v piesel and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling comes up .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same kind of typewriter .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so much rooted in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
and the first thing i &apos;m asking the question i &apos;m , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anyone else on the planet .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature , and it &apos;s all connected .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
and we don &apos;t tell us a favor if we make them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
we had a team that was working on a project in boston that took three people for two and a half months .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seven-year-old team and the prime minister at the same time .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
back to my real topic of natural user interface and the subject , which is usability .
of the people who stood when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
then , one day , he came back from walking and he said , &quot; dad , my legs , crystal . &quot;
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse shot that &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
please help us do that and try not just improve health , not just to improve health , but take it in your hand .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , the code for america program .
the first example requires what many of you know about and some of you estimate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
so then just such words emerge that we &apos;re using in the language of political correct speech over and over again .
but these concepts of the cyberage , which bring us these opportunities to rediscover our capabilities again .
and the main lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned , is that they &apos;re really different .
his cause of writing the piece becomes more and more and more of my personal cause to play it .
but there are no clubs that we can look around where to learn , how to make fire .
that &apos;s like if i were to say , shake your child , just knock it only three times .
it turns out it meant , in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your movie . &quot;
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation fuels , in about 18 months .
so , imagine if you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel like ?
one of the ways that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with the fact that you deceiving yourself .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way , original way , of solving a problem .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
so we had to develop a new way of which we were able to put these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our way of life .
are we using these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , which is more successful , which is more friendly ?
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physiotherapy .
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
if i went to a room -- like i was doing right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
unfortunately , this is the whole good news already , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot of a lot .
i got another gift , which was to look into the future , and come back and live differently .
we &apos;ve been able to get rid of a hundred genes from the 500 or so that are here .
so we overlist our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
because often people come , they can &apos;t do it use friendly , so that anybody can deal with it .
so for me , it seemed more about being in the right place at the right place at the right time .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have written by hand .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come in and look at this there , precisely because you can see what the problems you get .
do you say there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that are shifting things around ?
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time at choice improving our greater good .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
i was told me they &apos;re not going to bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
this also represents the value of this talk , so i hope d enjoyed you .
now , morgan , on behalf of transparency , this , what happened to the $ 7100 now ?
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two kinds of self , you will end up doing very different things .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately spontaneously , but this is going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the scientific method successes .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on the planet .
i think i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
as peter told us , not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be one of which there are such predictable for course , you can &apos;t prove that .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could do b .
but here we get evidence , if you get evidence , you have to adopt that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
i want to explain to you to this mechanism today , or approach something that &apos;s unconsciously familiar with .
people will cook up in their faith , which is so tight that you can &apos;t free them .
here we see this again , again , we &apos;re seeing this el , again , all the whole , single aggregate .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
so in other words , every year , the future has shrink after i &apos;ve been in the world .
if you surround with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it as well .
evolution is all about passage of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
so doing these things -- you know , reminds people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
now , if i &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
you push the decision -- push it up , even when it comes to your own best interest .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and persistence .
in the rich world there are diseases that have threatened millions of us only one generation , hardly there .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re said , &quot; we &apos;re going to take out of oil . &quot;
here we see a very basic service here . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s taken over the next century .
and that &apos;s going to get worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die of it again , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to think about it because things are changing .
quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
i want to start by asking you to think back to the time of your childhood when they were playing with building blocks .
it could be , for example , an american power plant , or a chemical plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
we find men in the marking rows of citizenship movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
that means , everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , avoiding it .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that make up a mac computer , like they came together .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect course of disease for a patient with breast pain .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous , and i say that because identity means power .
a commilitary of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a little bit too shrimp .
if you believe you &apos;re inside and out there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
the great digital warehead -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
the starting point is the computation of a supercomputer that people have only left 23 years on the planet for 23 years .
come to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me advice on how i can do this . &quot;
and he did , and when he discovered a hardensity in the bottom sector , he called the operators .
so , when you &apos;re confronted with the government problem , they don &apos;t care so much about using their voices .
so what we have here are the cover pictures of every single sports illustrated .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles da writes .
the reason i hold my wrist is because this is because this is the actual secret of illusion .
i know they were ratized , i know they were sexist , but they were great .
so we start to rely on computers for a process that is very different from classical engineering .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was only in one way .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they get increasingly unhappy the poorer they get .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that , you &apos;re doing that , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really about it properly , i started working on a mission .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s not to see , but it &apos;s all the time with me .
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
but we should just be familiar with this not telling a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
that in order to make music in the instrument , your musical doing and feeling should have been present before .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to collaborative problem solving .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust every future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we want to take away vital organs and plant them to other people .
because the music allows him to reform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
it turns out that miguel spent most of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
so that when as people , we try to connect a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
and i &apos;m important about to look back into the notes , even though i mean , to memorize them .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time are kind of dangerous .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and understand and on different levels .
what &apos;s quite wonderful is , when i &apos;m standing on the stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
and i brought this project as an example of how i &apos;m again addressed to this archaical cognitive models .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give their insent to sex or to marry .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did something i always do , and i wrote an article and i continued .
and he pointed at the tourists that came every day and usually have their cameras with them .
when i heard that , i thought , well , this is scary -- that &apos;s just the way my creative process is happening .
each generation looks at the pictures that they take at the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard , and will derive all of them .
that &apos;s the left half , that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
then this awkward feeling disappears , and it couldn &apos;t see you similar , and it gets more and more like it .
my mother was working on farms , then on a bloodline in a car factory , six days , double layers .
so i looked at them in a moment , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably got some birds . &quot;
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one that food actually tastes good .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or an ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
what about the people who don &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense for me , and that i think we should keep .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data to the data that we &apos;re producing data to the real world .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they were pushing water out of the country , and out into the river .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states today .
there was a meeting to reconciliation meeting , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of your way . &quot;
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would already have the same problems that people on this island have .
this isn &apos;t scientifically accurate , because we don &apos;t know how much cooled is cooled away .
