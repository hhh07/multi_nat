my grandmother never let me forget his life .
and let me show you a simple example .
you &apos;re just listening , and then they start talking .
i remember it was yesterday .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
let me show you how they work .
just think of that for a moment .
you just have to spread it as much as you can .
now can you play them in blue as well ?
no , we find what &apos;s inside there .
raise your hands . let me see .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
anyway , they do it in there .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
let me show you close to it .
this has got to go down , down to zero .
and in time , you can react to other things again .
is it all about the details or the colors ?
it was something we knew to do .
their problem is they have too little .
i think i may have heard more hands .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
our goal was just to say it , okay .
they were just like the people in this room .
so get rid of it ; save the shoes .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go another slide again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
and then it usually looks like this usually .
my mother called me for a few minutes after that .
so , help me do that .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
they know , science is not a company .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
but maybe you can still vote them .
i remember as if it was yesterday .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so here &apos;s another people who test it .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
and i becomes a character in the book .
what about life longer in good health ?
and the memory was playing in that head was happening .
and what does it actually look inside there ?
we understood that the weather is global .
so , we can &apos;t take these things at all .
i have something here that i want to show you .
in the countries where people come to money .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
how could it be possible that we did that ?
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
because actually , this human being is not interested in proof proof at all .
he &apos;s only fooling you and not himself .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s repair that .
today , i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
this is footage of a six-second duration .
and you say , what happens to these moments ?
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have anymore ?
here are the results that we just got .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
i think the curiosity is the curiosity at first .
that drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
in our own countries , we would never do anything like that .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
what we found is that it &apos;s moving really strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
you see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
and all of this leads to us to the one big question .
anyway . i certainly want to do that .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
the question is , why do people accept that ?
and they had to remove what we did .
now i &apos;m going to choose the government issue .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
so let &apos;s pretend here we have a machine here .
there &apos;s somebody there who didn &apos;t have childhood in the back there .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer is going to be like ?
no wanted to have something to do with the movie .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
what we want is to create the future .
now they &apos;re all back on their way back .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
no one &apos;s done like this in the world has done that yet .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and we need to make a lot of this device .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
i &apos;m so sorry . is she doing it crazy ?
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern is trying to see something .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
and i have to say , there was power .
but the best part is coming -- in a second .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
what happened is that we could do that .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i set up .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fingers go down .
so i was talking at a conference a few months later .
i hired them , and i went to the treatment .
and we want to make this material available to all .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i took a while to figure that out .
think about it . this attack is generic .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and if you don &apos;t , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
this is another look at the tree of life .
look , let me give you an analogy .
and then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
i think that &apos;s true of every human on the planet .
so these women met and they just talked .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and the third area , which is actually explaining itself .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
you zoomed in it . you can actually go into it .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
but what this picture is a problem .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
so just imagine two other little changes .
and that &apos;s like , &apos; non the message that you know .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
how many would choose to have good memory ?
so please listen to when a music is played .
so , go out and start inventing it .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
this is an idea worth spreading .
so you might feel like selling it .
and we can like to look at this now .
so my way of making films changed completely .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
there are some places we can turn to .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that is , the ants weigh much more than we do .
you can look around all these museums here .
how much money it takes to realize that ?
as a result , we &apos;re building up stronger social relations .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right ?
and here are two patients . these are their records .
so , climate change will become terrible for them .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and at all , you worked much less than i did .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
he described one of them as &quot; very common . &quot;
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put in watermarks .
next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
that &apos;s there , and that &apos;s what comes back again .
i &apos;m never going to play the way that i is at that moment .
maniok is something that eats half a billion people eat .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open you doors ?
and these were sort of the first of people developed game devices developed .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
i mean , i rarely saw these flat lines .
but what about that day , that particular day of friday ?
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
they can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
they teach them to open doors to their own .
so in other words , i define what i want first .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers do .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and i see the same process combining photos .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
and the world we live now in now looks like this .
i don &apos;t see reason why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website here .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke at all , but was joke .
do that once , and then experience the sentence .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and the world we lived looked like this .
i had a relationship to this beauty for several months .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
well , let me show you a little bit more of that .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
but are we going to make the best out of our game drive ?
but one of them is much worse than the other .
you &apos;d expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
you knew it was a trick with it , right ?
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a lot of loss .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
and so i made a little bit unusual decision .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and that was an experience in humility to me .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
but letting them down is not always that bad thing .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
i &apos;m probably many of you in the room probably know this trick .
you know , i had this idea of a movie .
why do i have to afford &quot; little car ?
and we want to bring this to a global level of the world .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say about it .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing now ?
and the same after the three months , it was too .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
and yet , we don &apos;t yet understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
the main problem here is sort of like aids .
and we &apos;re reinventing as often as we want .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
these are the people who shape my world view .
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
let me show you an example of what i mean .
it &apos;s also pointing up in other places of the book .
and fortunately , there are a lot of studies to do this .
and i went over and i just listened to it .
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s the point out of this ? &quot;
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much like . &quot;
you can say things here that are influence worldwide .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and that &apos;s what we learn and the rules of the game .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
they virtualize reality , and it &apos;s not computers .
so we walk away before , and where do we walk ?
there &apos;s a program that some of you may already know .
i first agree , that &apos;s logical .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
the child in me is really excited about such possibilities .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
a little bit more about you , which are not you .
i may have another 40 labor years inside of me .
now , now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and what was that for you ? what was it successful ?
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
but combined , you can create something special like this .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , not a hd , that was real .
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want to want ?
it was called the &quot; automatically connected rock . &quot;
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
well , because they don &apos;t know it used to be different .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
restore america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
but actually , it was an even more fun that night .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he recorded a famous picture . what did it mean ?
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
click , and whales , you &apos;re in the museum .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
we see the process that feeds itself .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
because the pictures made it feel real for them .
for the lower two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
and of course , how does design affects perception ?
so how does a human deal with certain things ?
so i &apos;m going to take a step back , and i &apos;m going to take the view .
ok , think of it as extreme self-motivation .
there &apos;s a political debate to intent in our country .
ask questions , ask evidence , ask evidence , ask evidence .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
and the fish was also fortunate enough to be there .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper than that .
but we don &apos;t know a little bit about where things are going .
it &apos;s the way it happened in the village earlier .
i know what people think when they see that .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to have disappeared here .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
imagine these images could really start to fly .
what is this new state that the world is starting to take ?
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
and my talk today is going to be mainly by these cognitive traps .
open the map , and jump with a click .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
you know , we &apos;re now hearing a lot about transparency right now .
and the predictions of as they read them are serious .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and again today we &apos;re also dependent on stories .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
and then they &apos;ve then ordered a whole bunch of simulations .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had effect .
so soon we should figure out what the goal is .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t entered .
i filmed in warfare areas -- difficult and dangerous .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush ?
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
but it wasn &apos;t that way in the &apos; 80s .
hey , pma , are you really serious ?
we can actually do the same things that we do with less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
they were asked to tell about their pain every 60 seconds .
well , the energy source has fallen over time .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
i &apos;m going to write further , because that &apos;s my job .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
well , today we all know about where our things come from .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world-changing games !
because we don &apos;t do things free by .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i &apos;d rather continue doing this work that i love .
and sophiolé ! it , despite all of this .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital thing is true .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
it &apos;s not even online yet . there &apos;s no streaming .
right now , we spend three billion hours a week online games .
how would you change your relationships and change the negative energy in it ?
is it also yellow for others , or is it affecting us ?
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict yourself .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
it &apos;s the form of refour behaviors , right ?
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and attention .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
they get a model that comes out of all over the world .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
the living self has no voice in that choice .
where &apos;s the greatest interest in doing what really is doing ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation fuels .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
in one place , the screen fills with leaves .
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
well , the next day , we were in cleveland .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate this around .
now , how do people die in the result of such a hack ?
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
one-meter is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
that &apos;s not how it doesn &apos;t work for the memoring self at all .
these are spaces that can be cleverly to a human being .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife like this .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
both cases naked up to me , ask me up .
that &apos;s why just thinking from the weigh to the weigh .
we just alert there the way we did .
many people talk from an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
so when it says , there are no soul .
this is , by the way , is the hardest part of my talk .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things the same .
i can &apos;t play today the way i did in 20 years .
over the course of that journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
when we start thinking about it that way , it changes everything .
this is star night , probably never seen like that before .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponential .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
and then we offer one of those great dunes to them .
now , in this area , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
it &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the plug .
the biggest difference between them is dealing over time .
but i really believe that something else comes to us .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
so we don &apos;t have one budget as other brands .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
and the question is , are these good news or bad news ?
we still know another where all the gas stations are .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s in there for a moment .
in both cases , they were doing well .
the previous example was about finding details .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , this is vision .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
the software usually takes a few years to do it .
now , where would you position your brain at this scale ?
now , how do you start talking the language of music ?
we need to go into the machinery of government .
i sent her home without talking to my upper doctor .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
and what was that i needed an expert .
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is going on .
the solar cost has fallen down by 50 percent last year .
it has moments of life , one after a time .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
one everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
there were no christmas trees . we did all of this .
i &apos;m going to play what these notes might mean .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
again , what potential do we want to call out now ?
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding on themselves .
if it didn &apos;t move anymore , they &apos;re buried them .
the conventional system looks like all over the world .
so what i &apos;m telling you about now is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is mies .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i knew she &apos;d come to goodbye .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask questions .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
welcome at fear . welcome at the risk .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best way , just the fire brigade .
they did it by selecting the country .
the things that are just used go into technical systems .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
so , if you could put the light on again .
yes , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
this is what happened . it wasn &apos;t a team had a stable structure .
so the device you see didn &apos;t work .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and as i turn around , the finger changes its position .
that already loses half its value in the first year .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
cats look at cats watching cats watching this video .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
what we see is that phosphorus is really critical .
i started thinking , well , i should just come in the project .
the words , as long as his friends , were now spoken his now .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
and first of all , first of all , it &apos;s to ask what &apos;s the right thing .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
that keeps us at the pole and keeps us evolve and going .
i haven &apos;t argued myself with my wife for two years .
that first one , that was more like a passionate monkey .
we &apos;re going to face a few more in the next few days .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
and others are another example are the ambients , intelligent systems .
the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer focused on their own .
so the driving force behind that is cyber superpower .
do you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
it &apos;s racing about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
makes it impossible to say how the picture was actually put together .
they add a blue one to a green one , and they can make light .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived you .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
and what we found was that there was actually a context .
we think about our future as an precautionary memories .
because music is a language and it &apos;s a language for communicating there .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
so they move around , and they make art installations like these .
that &apos;s why they help with it , ask people what people once .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
a typical wal-mart now offers you 100,000 products .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
which would you like to have if it could only have one ?
but also our perception itself , how do it fake us ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
how many doors does the house you live in ?
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
but so far , i &apos;m going to get it a little bit curious yet .
and then we started negotiating with the insulers .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something we do .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
i went home through the emergency department on my way .
depends of a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
when we looked at how income emotions variate emotions .
and i appreciate many of you have done that too .
that &apos;s all of them in the pre-winding phase .
this is what i want to present to you to two , maybe three examples as well .
very rarely you actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who , by the way , hits four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve used to things happening linear .
i had a 14-year-old black boy as a clients .
and then people could eat it , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
in there they &apos;re in , they want to go up to the end of the gangs .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it cleans up the water .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that already . thank you very much .
and then i come in immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sell . &quot;
and also , what you would think about today in the mind today .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and we can replace the oil with other energy from other energy reducers .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . hearulations .
but can you do , if you &apos;re into foreign one .
it &apos;s just that i think he &apos;s more likely to like it , right ?
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through masses , 20 an hour .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
but it turns out that &apos;s not all it yet .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts on taste .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
so there should be a nine to be at the beginning of my death number .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not doing it .
for example , would this somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
you have to admit that &apos;s a huge selection .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
let &apos;s call the animal vessel , it costs a lot of money .
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
why are they advertising us if we can &apos;t buy ?
this is an idiotic debate . she has to stop .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prefer against injustice .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing the legal area .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
that all of our survival is linked to survival every single person survival .
well , i sometimes play with them sometimes , but not very often .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-cellular community .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
this is the time period of time you fall in love .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
if one neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
i mean , how much do we drive from our memories ?
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
and because we &apos;re going to grow older , the wind will get bigger .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing going on the movie of stats .
so that really turned me , and i wanted more .
yes , this is what one &apos;s down there &apos;s just the load down there .
for example , the invention of language , was a little step in that direction .
depending on its behavior , we can predict structure and function .
there are many more people , but i lacking time .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
a few months ago went over , and i &apos;d just forgotten everything .
and immediately , i see another pattern that comes out .
each of these themes , of course , was made of many , many smaller decisions .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared in human anymore .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
we &apos;ve been using ourselves now in holland over three years .
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so it turned out of the same , bad team of one of the best .
and of course , in germany , it can never be there anymore . &quot;
a consequence of that was that the phone had never broken .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s part of it .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more force .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
now , where are we supposed to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
i studied woman printer , and she was in respiratory .
so the painter the belly the better the system . &quot;
the more money you make , the more happy you are .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
and they were lifted the way through the rest of the book .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
we &apos;ve moved before in what &apos;s called the avian age before .
well , your living self is not going to be happier .
this is the publication that we just finished recently .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat beat 300 .
since that time , we &apos;ve been getting all sorts of recognition .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding them this morning , &quot; he said .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in 2010 , we &apos;d just connected under two billion people online with each other online .
i have a friend , he &apos;s driving a passenger ati .
so there &apos;s no excuse to someone in this audience .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
i can say the canger is a man .
i know now it was the reason of the ocean .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
it was completely excluded that she could fail at that .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
they interact with their environment and their experience clearly .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
you can do this trick to your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
they were afraid of pirate , rape and death .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes hasn &apos;t changed very much .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we rushed his bed so he can look outside .
just this airport has a area of 100 square kilometers .
we put games in order to escape the suffering of the real world .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all of these extensions .
this goes much further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
our gut is a wonderfully host environment for these bacteria .
about that time , an anecdote talks that you might know .
i couldn &apos;t have done it any better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-cleaning .
it means that we &apos;re reaching a cultural impact next to the scientific assignment .
someone had collapsed , and they &apos;d been hacked the system .
but a lot of people are trapped in a very strange position .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good medial opportunity .
this actually didn &apos;t just took two thousand eight shape , these networks .
it &apos;s no longer necessary to whistle or sing a song .
so in my opinion , it &apos;s a very charged hack .
i brought seven some underwear with me , and that &apos;s all .
now , i wondered , how can i really bring this over ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert like this .
i think somehow such a six dollars or something like that .
turned the garbage ton on the side . went home .
six : social decline . 65 deaths .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
and do guess what we found in the code of fear ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
and they did this with what we call lead-cards .
imagine that every single one is operated by people .
what about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
but instead of getting panicked , he just stopped .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had last half a year .
but somehow , we can get rid of this problem .
i like things that are strange . i like weird things .
i looked in the rustle , and it was a little bit pink .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
i first ate him in a restaurant in southern spain .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
and these are now just the biohackers now , the individual people .
this is a clip from this code of the code of fear .
so i was looking at this , when is what , of course or intuitive .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity depends on our humanity .
this is what struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
so you should be put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
we &apos;re degrading a human being worth for our society .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
finally , as we &apos;re proceeding , we should welcome fear .
there , in my think , there was a very good code .
that &apos;s actually the real confusion of man and machine .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
what about a set of new voices , never heard voices before ?
possibilities that would not have been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish was taken on a smooth trip .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
well , the living self lives its life continuously .
it &apos;s renewables , as they often call &quot; often .
and the best part about it is that they connect with magnets .
and that &apos;s where i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
the noted notes have the function of the letters of a script .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
at the last ted conference , i &apos;ve given an introduction to lhc .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
and i ask , how technically competent was this diagnosis ?
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
and i was like , &quot; well , how are you communicating ? &quot;
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well , the two types of self record two terms of happiness .
photos like this : a building site along a much driving street .
i grew up with a wooden portion of science fiction .
an eight-hand brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensively , not intense .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control minerals prosperes .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really dabading .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
what &apos;s interesting about this is , if i can take a little trip .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
a few of them . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
so a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so find programs that can care about the most former numbers .
how can a judge turn someone into something they &apos;re not ?
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
the composer becomes more and more a friend you live with .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me .
and within a few years , lego moved to every household .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
here i &apos;m going to zoom in on a little bit . we &apos;re going to look right here .
so , when i was 15 , i decided to be a diver .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion imaging points , i think .
i always found fireflies in a glass .
from my angle of view , i looked up and down the janitor down .
many of you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player is certainly beating three out of 10 beats .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work , by the way .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
she said it would be like a thunderly train of air .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to get worse .
again , so in any store , you can get things back .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
and she asked him , what are your hobies ?
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what makes you interest in them .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
that &apos;s where we have cases like diginotar .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft companions .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill it .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego room .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re preparing our lives for it .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go that way .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later for that .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going on to .
think of this as a imagery of this as a flying image of fly .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize of winner .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
most people usually start to orient themselves about the task .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our minds .
so the question is , can you get that to zero ?
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away .
because with marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
does i look like i could just write up a song ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
sometimes i lose the balance , and i &apos;m a story , at the end of it .
but of course , it &apos;s all the sum of all , a lot of ideas .
when they walk , yes , each footprint destroys the ground .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
so , for example , shtz the environment , drive less cars .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that they have to face .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
most of you will be completely ignored by the remembering self .
and the online criminals are very easy to understand .
i &apos;d like to conclude with a story that i &apos;m really excited about .
so you can ask : how happy is this living self ?
does a single person in the audience ever see anyone die of masses ?
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
you can like to test it after my talk in your rooms .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
wr wants to help people who were convicted innocent .
and the best part about this may be what we expect in health .
we produce androgen , and we &apos;re talking to androgens .
that is , we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not harmful about that .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
they now have five-percent renewable energy rate .
but as you &apos;ve been talking to different people around the world about these possibilities .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
and if you can do , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this is technological innovation that we have today .
they feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the origin .
bonobos , together with chimpanzees , are our next living relatives .
and this is the value of that experience , this kind of simple exercise .
the first of these traps is a contradiction to admit complexity .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
you &apos;re usually just wrong , and some of them don &apos;t come , some of them don &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t know how people are going to be terrible .
they spend most of their time in assembling structures constantly growing structures .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
i realize breathing with the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s supported .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
ceos &apos;s a little bit about average . but this is where it gets interesting .
this is one of the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
then the same thing happens in a good , fair conversation .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the next few years .
we all need to ultimately believe things that we can &apos;t see .
if we exaggerate it , we can pour a little bit back .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what allows us to modern progress .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
it &apos;s called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
he said , &quot; there are no death penalty in germany .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack of he &apos;s supposed to go to first .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
car colors , outcolor of the car -- i have 56 options .
and as general term , we can use the word intersexuality for that .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
so you can see , with this movie , we wanted to tell the real version .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
and i thought that was going to be so hard , so painful .
tempt will be part of the show , which is quite gone off .
the scaffold from the ladazzles came out of the rest of the world .
okay . anyone who &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
you &apos;re basically learning how to read first before you only speak one word .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
a deception becomes something that , because someone perceives it that way .
bryan , they actually put a string here to vibrate here .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking about thinking , in a very important way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis , and you know what ?
and she was much worse for a than she was for b in the memory .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it brings pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
all the parties , all the questions in society , supported this .
be further there for your contribution , whatever you want to be .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we record information ?
they knew all the bits and bytes they had to attack .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
and the suggestion was to build many more coal factories .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
the reason for that is , the government could track where a text came from .
so how are we going to operate the question of the character ?
and these apps will use our hands to improve our communities better .
and today , we all feel like owners of our pop culture .
i wrote down four words up , and i &apos;d like to explain them a little bit .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
and we became , for a four and a half years to a real family .
and all i can say about this is , why do we fight that ?
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
because it &apos;s waking something that &apos;s lost , in a way , lost .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the story of anatomy .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
big data is being transformed into great opportunities for organizations around the world .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
you &apos;re agreed with him freely sniffs if it snips .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
by now , there are a lot of people working there , and they can all get involved .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
now why am i asking from my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening to ?
they &apos;re new nanotechnology on the way , nano-materials .
if you do review and you never make the mistake again .
listen consciously listen and tell if it tastes you or not taste .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system , will notice it .
but this picture , in fact , is completely put together , from photographs of different places .
to keep twins , right with the composer .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
how good do you think are you about making the decisions ?
right now , we can get nutrients back in agriculture in this way .
he ended the whole process of thought , and he did something completely new .
beyond the simple games , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems that exist today .
at our views , we got into all sorts of inconvenient areas .
if i &apos;m not right , then the changer is not a man .
we not just tell stories when we go to tell stories .
and this then fires , in the headwords , open knowledge and citizen science .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
we can better deal with more categories than we deal with more choices .
the key tool of information facility has been stories since any time .
and that &apos;s the core cause of the biohackers .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire brigade .
because when the water comes out , it goes down in the atlantic .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground , first of all ,
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , yes .
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games .
and then doors up rocks up so he will lock them up the view .
and in the end , they just want to get the hereditary remains .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients .
now this is a three-sentence that describes us a logic .
tell me about the why phase -- what does it bring us ?
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really understood what that means .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transistor was only for experts .
and that &apos;s where they developed great apps , worked with urban workers .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to tell you about today .
this shows the enormously large role that a marine protected area can play .
a nuclear reactor , which provides even a solution to the waste .
whether the music is pplumed or too sweet ?
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
he asked octavio to become his pocket .
so quantum mechanics says that unmovable objects feel the same .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
you might think he was hunting fins , but that &apos;s not true .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
if we look forward , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
semi-time , people do a short call , they go to bathroom .
this , of course , is high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
also , tans &apos;s mother now here in the fourth or fifth row .
now there are 10,000 parodies from friday &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
you can only recognize the meaning of the letters when you can get the language to it .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
so this is the whole concept , the whole movie , from the beginning to end .
and this is a way of thinking that i think is appropriate .
every single one of you could be famous over the internet to the next saturday .
