hey , why not ?
good job ! yeah !
that &apos;s super important .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
and this was fascinating .
that is doable .
what would you say ?
robert gupta .
so what happens here ?
thank you very much .
sound familiar ? right .
why not live longer ?
they have similar principles .
oh , that guy .
1,000 , very good .
that &apos;s our present .
that &apos;s the system .
you could see manhattan .
this was the result .
there &apos;s no normal .
centers were established .
just do your job .
all that interests me .
so what happened here ?
lento , slow .
yes , hello .
yes , hello .
very different notion .
explore .
what a fish .
i actually am .
thanks so much .
that was all .
wonderful , right ?
and they did .
they all matter .
totally inefficient .
that &apos;s efficient .
not very sustainable .
play &apos;s essential .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
so meet al .
tremendously exciting .
nothing will happen .
what did they do ?
ban is blank .
i was amazed .
it is generic .
pretty good , right ?
quite a few more .
it &apos;s a crisis .
he answers the door .
so they know everything .
not guilt management .
how do we know that ?
and i was an artist .
because , you know something ?
yes , that &apos;s possible .
we can do it differently .
so how does it happen ?
let &apos;s call him don .
how engaged you are .
what will these people want ?
can we do this differently ?
and those days are gone .
bg : thank you .
can i be honest ?
this is the last one .
you can enter inside it .
so this is for real .
so where do we go ?
this would have been fine .
and i thought about that .
what is the media today ?
so let &apos;s have a look .
let me give you an example .
so , you can do it .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot;
i was exposed to him .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
and that &apos;s important .
but you know what ?
it has sensors .
we can do that .
what was the result ?
here is the video .
yes , milliseconds .
but you know what ?
score them again .
that &apos;s very good .
the whole environmental discussion .
these guys make money .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;ve got a question .
i don &apos;t believe that .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
so this is a wish .
and it must go back .
fly away , cat .
why do we do that ?
they &apos;re using their hands .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s horrible .
oh , my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
we love entertainment .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
it is possible though .
does that sound good ?
it &apos;s a lot .
we &apos;re taking off .
i can help you .
thank you . thank you .
three times out of 10 .
that &apos;s your only chance .
which was awesome .
a long time , yes .
this is stephen watt .
the sun is rising .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , so to speak .
thank you very much , guys .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
go home to where ?
you need time .
we were poor .
thank you guys .
and he says ...
is that all ?
it goes fast .
this is not ...
1.5 million .
this is hard .
what does it mean ?
yeah . okay .
i &apos;m tom .
here it is .
that was us .
... yet .
thank you .
nice one .
music as language .
from seattle ...
yes , hello .
oh , my god .
which is singing .
what does this mean ?
solar technology is ...
a few less .
we know that .
that &apos;s wrong .
we love innovation .
like twice over .
after one week .
it &apos;s interesting .
ta-da !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
wooo !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
come on .
60,000 .
pretty simple .
terrible .
sustainable .
unique .
fine .
thanks .
thank you .
positively .
thank you very much .
just because of that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
just one single one ?
is that something ?
yes , well ...
it &apos;s true .
no kidding .
it &apos;s possible .
maybe not .
ole !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah .
right ?
yes .
right ?
right ?
yeah .
thanks .
right ?
why ?
okay .
yes .
really .
right ?
whereas .
yes .
yes ?
okay .
creativity .
right ?
no .
thank you .
right ?
awesome .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
you see ?
you see ?
whoa !
sort of .
thank you .
have you ?
thank you .
hello !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
you see ?
my wife told me it .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
here you have it again .
so what why hacking ?
finally : epic meaning .
this picture &apos;s from there .
so that started the journey .
first overtime , second .
want to feed the world ?
it connected those two people .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
but it was very sad .
and what is that thing ?
you could have done better .
and here &apos;s the thing .
but they do the job .
that &apos;s very risky .
does that make you curious ?
and how did you feel ?
and that worked pretty well .
what happens is this .
very scary .
they called me .
superior technology .
but i felt worse .
these changes are coming .
the orange tractor .
this is really exciting .
but the point is ...
how about fitness ?
your plant can blow up .
and then presented .
and that &apos;s nothing .
what what happened there ?
one is south korea .
why should i worry ?
they really loved it .
same thing , only bigger .
well , i was next .
you know , is it rational ?
i &apos;ve loved only two .
she shares her experience with others .
all right , let &apos;s go .
that can &apos;t be a problem .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
and it was a huge success .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and the answer is yes .
this data was not available before .
how many people would choose creativity ?
pattern recognition should also work .
this was my first sunburn .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
so you can have this cloud .
it &apos;s not our burden .
because you can train that .
think about your own choices .
so it &apos;s a circle .
i wanted to support them .
i sometimes push too hard .
and then everybody moved down .
i was in awe .
her mother raised her alone .
like that , you know .
who does the very best ?
tell me about this world .
and here is a surprise .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
thank you for your attention .
this happened around christmas .
okay , there &apos;s some .
you saw the big peak .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plus sign .
who are these cousins ?
i want to ask a question .
we need to get the message out .
you can see this at the bottom .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
why not think about it this way ?
what am i going to look at ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we love technology . we love creativity .
he kept pacing back and forth .
this guy &apos;s name is tempt .
but what are we doing with it ?
you can see the water coming .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
inventing his own narrative .
is it something about the light ?
now , what does that mean ?
i was devastated .
that &apos;s exemplary .
what do you think happened then ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
we made this game in 2007 .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
what is decisive , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s valid .
the soul is something mental , leibniz said .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
this is a chart of what it looked like .
so , i &apos;m going to wrap up now .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
we were a group of twenty people .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
and that means there are too many of us .
is it going to be my size ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
and this is felix , actually .
so , what do we have to do ?
it would be unconscionable .
and it opens up a map .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
most people here have heard of them .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
we have online criminals .
so i made one .
here &apos;s another example .
but it hadn &apos;t .
there is no feed .
people were going crazy .
but it gets worse .
it keeps you fresh .
he liked it very much .
does anyone see anything specific ?
he is my grandfather .
good afternoon , everybody .
and then it went international .
so let me recap .
this is an old study .
and so i did .
he kept pointing here .
that is a fantastic question .
some have come and gone .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
there were remixes .
here you see the city .
it was different in china .
so here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m totally with you .
dk : 60,000 .
thankfully , right ?
that &apos;s a great question .
and then it happened again .
the first : cut .
thank you .
why do this ?
it won &apos;t .
it feels great .
i &apos;m surprised .
thanks for listening .
they actually hurt .
i swear .
i represent children .
and i understand that .
i am a writer .
it goes against justice .
jk : both .
but what are your fish eating ?
maybe 10 times more .
be a mentor .
turn the camera off .
my hunches again .
but the wrong things .
thank you very much .
after only one trip .
yeah . all right .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so here it is .
tremendously challenging .
the data came back .
what creates the illusion ?
don &apos;t be daunted .
i don &apos;t think so .
what needed to be done ?
there were still fishes .
and many people forget this .
there are billions of them .
will i like the color ?
my name is amit .
privacy is implied .
aww , thank you .
is that your opinion ?
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
his name is paul offit .
they sort of go like this .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s the two-cent tour .
the work of the interpreter .
that does not hold for emotions .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
but where are we of use ?
well , what does that mean ?
let &apos;s call him don too .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only country in the world .
how do we humans actually function ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
so what happened years afterward ?
and i grew up in india .
i will never forget it .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i never will forget it .
or is it photography ?
okay , a bit more .
what is the soul ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
this is really cool . &quot;
very expensive real estate .
yes , there it is .
and the answer is no .
and it even got better .
keep going . have fun .
ohhhh .
crisis . death . disaster .
have you seen these guys ?
and i felt really good .
we have three main groups .
give pee a chance .
and i always have been .
an almost identical structure .
you make comparisons .
and why is it true ?
he had had the experience .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
she did it in secret .
okay . thank you very much .
this is happening to us today .
well she was back all right .
huh . hang on a moment .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
they had to worry about being bombed .
and so , we need energy miracles .
why does this happen in the first place ?
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
one of two things is going to happen .
but i carried on with my work .
there &apos;s nothing poisonous in it .
the first two theorems are logically correct .
and i went back to work .
what about longevity ?
the match begins -- silence .
do you want them distressed ?
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
yes , here is the data .
so , i just started playing .
talk about getting by with nothing .
but it &apos;s not documented .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
and this video is real time .
i like things that are different .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
and it really changed the dynamic .
i went to prison -- difficult .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
they sell certificates .
the truth is more like this .
because to me it means memory .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
and then we said , okay ,
it &apos;s spreading virally .
how and what did they feel ?
it can know where we are .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
we say sustainability in germany .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
but what will come in the future ?
this is a photograph of the object .
do you know what envy is ?
but we need this everywhere .
it sounds scary .
um , my brand ?
that &apos;s scary .
another very exciting phenomenon .
next would be nuclear .
leave that up to us .
but totally effective , right ?
it &apos;s entirely insignificant .
thanks for you patience .
what else is risky ?
and i tried something interesting .
we are a smaller brand .
just be who you are .
and the family gathered .
i remember my first fire .
i fell out of love with this fish .
dark urine . dark .
zero emissions , you see ?
what defines a story ?
and his answer was yes .
the reasons for writing it .
something shoots through my head .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
at least not to navigate .
why did i go into medicine ?
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
all the adults knew the risks .
were you ever envious ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
so the correlation is low .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
it turns out to be really difficult .
how far would you get with that ?
and those are the neural structures .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
we certainly need one to succeed .
if you think about it , right ?
you can go all the way through .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
and so we measured its motion .
and that can make a big difference .
but the reality is far from it .
and apparently it was quite popular .
to the book and to the image .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
so with that , i thank you .
that &apos;s just about the minimum .
this has nothing to do with science .
they flooded the canals .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
five million people use it every month .
but it does require a lot of planning .
it causes leukemia in children .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
for a year we were penniless .
now we do the same with airplanes .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
and i see greg lemond now .
we can win back our nutrients .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
that must be our difference in age .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
you can show that you were there .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
i think it &apos;s odious .
do we really want to go there ?
they had been pushed genetically .
music is medicine . music changes us .
he only has use of his eyes .
these will be irresistible .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
thinking , you know , two percent .
we started this over 15 years ago .
lego made it accessible .
and there are several reasons for this .
i like really nice clothes .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
because we live on a water planet .
privacy is not up for discussion .
i am a redefined physician .
that image reminded me of something .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
something stiffened inside me .
i could draw . i could paint .
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe .
they are building an epic story .
you have not changed the story .
and there &apos;s good news here .
my name is brian goldman .
so what was the next step ?
this is not a finished story .
but there are two problems with that .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
so not like a detox .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
the whole building is made of water .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
today , there are 2.3 million .
what should our report card look like ?
but , but , you know what ?
you can play with a different type .
is it just imaginary ?
everybody needs a fishbowl .
and really you do the same thing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
what other brands are like that ?
so the white lines here are population .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
and he actually says it that way .
and then some very funny things happened .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
you have that much uncertainty .
this is a lot of volume .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i mean , that was epic .
the data says it all the time .
for example perception in this context .
and this made me really sad .
they then also say , why ?
so what happened on this day ?
everybody talks about happiness these days .
they were still kind of happy .
so let me remind you .
it really comes from these artists .
she was back and near death .
now how could this come about ?
i highlighted it here .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
this is a game for outside .
and i memorized everything .
does anybody know what this is ?
he showed it to javier .
and we absorb all of it .
so that &apos;s the good news .
2.5 to one , great .
now we talk about water wars .
she did it for three years .
it is a completely different notion .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
that &apos;s god , you know .
they were seeing something magical .
play is not frivolous .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
he was actually collecting fish .
no had never been an option .
okay , we can do that .
how could we help you ? &quot;
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
and one time we caught a live one .
and she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
every bit of waste is a nutrient .
we can apply these things to other examples .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
and so there are too many of us .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and the form has something to do with it .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
so that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
it will start to look more and more like you .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly .
that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
an autistic pupil .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and that was 19 yeas ago .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
italy wins . yeah .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
let &apos;s make it kogi . &quot;
it &apos;s this , just like this .
so , paul &apos;s a terrorist .
which one would you like the most ?
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
i almost never cook with it .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
i began to feel a bit better .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
now this is one of the images .
we went and looked at a site .
and here you have the graphic again .
we are dependent on two countries .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
because technologically it &apos;s just not possible .
he pointed at the algae .
that &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
four and a half thousand people live there .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and then they execute on it .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
so humans can &apos;t be pigs .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
and it was what i was feeling .
over the hills and all that .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
that is exactly what you are doing .
this is true . i believe this .
but with the right design , please .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
we can support them in doing good .
something really weird is going on here .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
what will these three billion people bring ?
we were given very accurate data .
it was really , really quite profound .
all of these are consuming questions .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
we can support them in doing good .
and women successfully argued that .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
you should ask for some of that .
even cats were watching this video .
the roof also is covered with water .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
so let &apos;s start with sunday .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
it was not drowned yet .
first you see from back to front .
i never knew him in real life .
he retreated into silence .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
so scott gets this call .
everybody applauded politely .
now look at this curve .
so i followed my hunches .
they literally flipped the switch .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
it &apos;s part of our life .
what do you think happens next ?
we worked well into each night .
there are . there always are .
the side product is clean water .
we need to go far , quickly .
he turns off the engines .
it might take a moment to load .
let me read you the entry .
jimmy kimmel actually .
from the modern to the computer society .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
we talk about it ambivalently .
we go through initiation rites .
it &apos;s about repowering america .
so , this is world without oil .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
the captain waved me over .
a dalmatian , exactly .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
also , these are intermittent sources .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
the chef had overcooked it .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a solemn part .
the shores are from a different location .
we have measles in this country now .
you can be logical and intuitive .
i lived in parallel worlds .
and that was the onset of als .
that was the first upright primate .
someone made an old timey version .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
not even the truth will set them free .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
how are you going to feed the world ?
perhaps we should take another look at this .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
156 nations carry our television channel .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and even lomborg has changed .
dosage has something to do with this .
everybody would like to make people happier .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s vanished .
and just to say , what is information ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
you put a box like this over there .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
we talk about bold , fresh .
he shook his head , no .
i felt like anyone could do that .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
that will take place next april .
they had a concept of blue blood .
these are cell phones of the future .
they &apos;re homelands of somebody .
what takes twenty-five milliseconds ?
then i see the dalmatian .
so that was the reason for the project .
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
... meaning not so optimistic .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
this is an ecological network .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
that which i just presented to you .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
let me tell you a bit about it .
so littlebits is open-source .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
so that &apos;s a tough one .
say what you feel .
it &apos;s completely directed .
he died broken by history .
here &apos;s the building working .
you always lose rare animals .
they speared each other .
it will get to you .
they stopped us from being inspired .
i represent people on death row .
i had written these crazy things .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i think this is really cool .
let &apos;s starting with sensing .
now we see the opposite effect .
so two cycles are created .
we design unique elements into this .
that might sound unusual at first .
so , please forgive me .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
the bricks are color-coded .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
one billion people will go hungry today .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
it &apos;s to supplement the experience .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
i &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
he &apos;s wasting his time on nonsense .
our magazines are read by millions .
and this is about shifting baseline .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
and then my brother started staring at me .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
we can re-invent things all over again .
this is bjorn sundin .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
and it just disturbed me so much .
they even can bring with them some financing .
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
but then you really want to go deep .
defeat would have come too easily .
i would like to prove that to you .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
and every morning i hop on it .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
he was over sixty at the time .
that was more for emphasis .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
was a very a very fancy project .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
and it will sound completely different from before .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
and the object of this is quite simple .
architects and engineers , thankfully .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
and i had to get out of town .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
her father died soon after she was born .
and i began giving her my rap .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
so , this crazy story might be true .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
i hold the knife in my hand .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
blissful productivity . i love it .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
we have reached a kind of equipoise .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
with people , it is released in the urine .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
i don &apos;t know who recognises what .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse .
it &apos;s separating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
we &apos;re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage .
but there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
and moreover , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up .
this this hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out loud .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise .
over here , these are the apsaras .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and who could have predicted any of this ?
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
i founded an institute with this in mind .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imagined .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
i call this &quot; shiny tiger . &quot;
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
the world today has 6.8 billion people .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
today they &apos;re called project executing organizations .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
i wanted to restore health from disease .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
this is the machine below geneva .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
we still think it is pristine .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
but then reality &apos;s always unpredictable .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
the official dogma of what ?
thursday : confidence is key .
we talk about drowning in data .
i was trying to preserve the body .
we vanquished it . puff .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
well i went into the courtroom .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
that proves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
they laughed more than you guys are .
you can drill into a particular year .
we object to genetically engineered food .
the three words are : do you remember ?
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and let me begin with one example .
you can zoom around very simply .
maybe we can see it as change .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
we think about energy scarcity .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
now , that blew my mind .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
what ? that really flipped me out .
you move around , you have fun .
repower america . find out more .
i call it the rising billion .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
but it has an unexpected twist .
protect the environment , consume less energy .
they need to tell me about my brand .
third : escalation of expectations .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
now you see the dalmatian .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
and i thought i could blend in .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
so again , that was a real good match .
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
so that made sense , that was a match .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
and that &apos;s a multi-million dollar corporation .
and he whispered in my ear .
engines , gearshift -- four choices .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
you can have a succession of changes .
we need to go for more research funding .
and here every piece is very well planned .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
this is alfred gonzalez .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
and , finally , this storage problem .
it &apos;s the so-called osit model .
but so many over the years were helped .
the third technique : categorization .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
now i put a bass line in .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
this is about one percent of the total population .
no one has to green-light your idea .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
we have been here for about 130,000 years .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
what do you do with certificates ?
so these were my prime motives .
instruments have developed .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
or take lipstick .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
remember those nappies again ?
monday : color is powerful .
imagine mozart being efficient .
they actually make us worse off .
it &apos;s called batting average .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
if you burn coal , no .
we asked around and nobody knew .
the flows have increased .
so what are archaic models ?
if you burn natural gas , no .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
second half . end of normal time .
say , there are no predictors .
and the list can go on forever .
she kind of set us up .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
feasting ? i was totally confused .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
this was the sailfin grouper .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
this is an annual melting river .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
we don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
this is a modest little app .
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
thank you , danny kahneman .
his personal impressions of the waterlilies .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
a lot of my clients are very young .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
he will have to process that as the present .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
you see the timeline on the top .
here are two different jewelry displays .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
and the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
in two hours it &apos;s biodegraded , wherever it is .
the first theorem is , klaus claims there is no soul .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
this is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
so , let me give you a little peek .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
protect the environment , produce less rubbish .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
i do get tired , as we all do .
but play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
and here you can see roberto dancing .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
in other domains -- the world of communications .
so to him , they were just blocks .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
we have twenty percent in germany .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
and there is this stunning silence .
the company headquarters are right here .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
amanda is wearing our elegs set .
both are viable ; both take off .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
there wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
they become rarer because we fish them .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
and we can see that it can be done .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
they reversed the flow of water .
we don &apos;t companies patenting life .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
and so that got me very excited .
you probably saw it on the news .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
save those . kill off the rest .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
no apple has ever tasted the same .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and to report back to my attending .
these nappies are everywhere practically .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what is brand gerry ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
and , being young , i said , expectation .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
it &apos;s about making a beneficial poop print .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
... these dosages have something to do with it .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
and they didn &apos;t have photolithography .
good , really good , maybe an all-star .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
and so every drop was a little bit different .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
of course not everything should be compostable .
this is a dead turtle .
there are some that are much more spatial .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
yes , so , what is biohacking ?
goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
beginners &apos; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
so that worked . so booya for scott .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
there are also technical cycles .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
every footprint is disadvantageous there .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
well it was a friday , this is true .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
it &apos;s all compostable all of it .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
here &apos;s this couple on the hamptons .
china can make up for that in one second .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
the first on here is the classic , apple .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
picasso &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
now i &apos;ll put some percussion in .
you know , i was a real science geek .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
of course this lends itself to a smart grid .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grouped together .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
it was four and a half years ago in italy .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
so not saving , abstaining from , avoiding .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
it &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
we don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , <<unk>> terised by language .
a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
i no longer want to postpone anything in life .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
these theorems are absolutely logical and correct .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
let &apos;s take sneakers for example , right ?
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
it was summertime : i had shorts on .
they don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
and we built an ipad application .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
grants and sponsors were sought .
there &apos;s no problem with overpopulation among trees .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
he says , &quot; brace for impact . &quot;
so we start with a windows dropper .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
it &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
go bother leonard cohen . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
because they have special skills of facilitation .
and his whole work process changed after that .
we called it digital water pavilion .
play is the glue that binds us together .
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
and then it &apos;s less usable or user friendly .
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
so that &apos;s occupythesec movement has done .
but those are all the roads in the u.s .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
they had 348 different kinds of jam .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
or are you more of a down attribute ?
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
and we &apos;ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity .
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
it is natanz , and it is only natanz .
let &apos;s make a short provisional appraisal .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
emc presents : &quot; embrace transparency . &quot;
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
now he &apos;s brought a tractor into the scene .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
then i would say , my warm condolences , you see ?
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
i can say , the german chancellor is a man .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
it &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; the starry night . &quot;
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
and we say that word with such contempt .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
when i say realism , i mean photo-realism .
the dog ! i was stunned with jealousy .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
the ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
well diginotar is a c.a .
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big placebo .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
they put her on a ventilator .
we no longer produce .
i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
she had irreversible brain damage .
it could happen in learning time scales .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
he smiled and said , oh ?
it was this misguided war on drugs .
what happened is the the so-called machine age .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
in other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
he only lived until the age of thirty-nine .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
it is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise .
my male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
the brochures still say it is untouched .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
one a baby needs about six-thousand nappies .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
well , we presented this to mayor belloch .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
there &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
we went back to the titanic wreck .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
