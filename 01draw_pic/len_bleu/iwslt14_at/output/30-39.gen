so , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way , if you &apos;re not available , you have to get energy .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people talked a lot about what would happen in 2000 .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed to do .
and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
we have the trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes we lose science in itself , and there is no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
i loved going to this business , but at one point i was wondering , well , how come you never buy anything ?
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live on .
it &apos;s a direct advertising , not for puma per company , but for helping this company to successfully make these products successful .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s clearly becoming more available .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of the time , and you all wanted to go to the past .
so the idea is to , beside showing that brands are part of life , actually , to get them to finance the film ?
and i called her up , and i tapped her knowledge to compare her expertise with what we found in the code and the data .
if you go on that path , where beliefs and magic replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
now , he &apos;s continuing to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
so you have to deal with it , because that means , not just changing it , but it &apos;s better , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about discovering new groups of genes .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
and that &apos;s something that grows through the complexity that people use , grows with , and whose use for the user is always going to grow up with the application .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 , exactly the same day , at the exact same moment , each one that has a baby -- okay .
do you not fear writing your whole life and never creating a book that anyone in the world cares ? never again ?
and you &apos;ll answer these questions , whether that means doing all the tasks that i &apos;m advocating you and not getting good grade in my course .
and all right , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet and have a little crazy , and also have a vision .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and to the magic , the fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen all of you in your life have seen such a performance .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
and it connects us all together to something much bigger , and it &apos;s able to evolve faster than we have been .
and these are not the features of old media , and they &apos;re not going to hit the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria , do you realize that each of us in our gut is leading more bacteria than cells in the rest of our body ?
unfortunately , sometimes even children who are trying to find their parents who , in some cases , have never seen them .
bill , i think i &apos;m speaking for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
and this ability to virtualize virtual reality , and they also needed people in the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing .
now it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and you put enough energy in there , you get there too far .
i combined it with my earlier preference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because when i was using the camera , the process was a lot more in planning .
and we hope , of course , that we then spread a bit like that , and then we &apos;re pretty much connected , so that sales can also be more people involved .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally reconstruct government function in a way that can actually achieve something by strengthening society .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be about the highest time to understand what that means .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i always want to make it look like you could have , in a photograph .
and he drew again for the first time in both his family and his friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot .
the same technology that the human insulin can produce in bacteria that can make viruses that can &apos;t only protect itself , but also serve for the immunity to other viruses .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after playing with them , even when they &apos;ve defeated us miserable .
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals and a farm that measures its success in the health of their predators .
now , when we telephone calls a couple of weeks ago , they were talking to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup poll .
now you &apos;re going to wonder why all the designers of this shape are starting to deal with such natural archaic forms of communication , interaction and so on and so forth .
now , this is kind of a sad thing for the hackershot , because it &apos;s not what she actually started , and what &apos;s actually been standing behind .
and you could have combined it with government services , if it had been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to federal services .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protects you from the consequences of your work .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect of the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve been playing with the movie a little bit more money .
we believe because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is , has a human being deserved to die for one of them ?
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time for us to think about it , about the world we want to leave our children .
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
i think we all would understand the mood that woody allen expressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach immortality through my work .
a place where women are leading the prescription , saying sex is hello , and the game is defined the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
it &apos;s not going to take long before reality is going to be that there &apos;s going to be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and there &apos;s going to be increasingly available for everybody .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s probably not so stupid and it &apos;s going to bite itself to keep us talking for a few minutes . &quot;
and i can say that for the reason now we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully never seen it .
it also raises me upset about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in being involved in this .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical thing , but not normal , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person if you really knew it ?
now , there are some of us who are forgetting that , in a way , when i say &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being .
and if you want to be an informed citizen to be able to make meaningful decisions in society and talk to you , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no one .
but then he got older and quieter , and he told me that one day he was driving on a rapid street in los angeles , and it was all changing for him .
and then when all the fingers come in on time , and really like it is in the notes , they come out sounds like music together .
and that &apos;s important because you can only look through the web sites in this way , look at the whole web lost in the same way .
so what it means is that incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions about work , again and again and again , whether we should or not work .
and in a couple of hours , he lands and rent a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to be one of those amazing ted dinner tonight .
this evidence of the fact that , in the inside of the bub , it actually was related to the fire , but it can &apos;t say that loud .
and then their pupils are expanding , they &apos;ve come out in front of their head , and they &apos;re kind of looking down and swallowing , and they &apos;re starting to tell their stories .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing that really brings you all together is this fascination of technology .
there &apos;s a lifelong self that lives in the present and is able to see the present , to reexperience the past , but essentially only has the present .
she took me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t tell me . &quot;
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that are around us in our everyday lives .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i &apos;m going to ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to adopt gary &apos;s offer .
and in the course of the movie , we had over 500 companies that were up and down companies saying no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
it was silent . then a woman said , &quot; our story is impossible that we ever respeak for systematic killing people .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody would get into an airplane this morning , fly to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s over ohio .
about three or four years ago , i got a call in the middle of the night from this teacher , woman posted , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
what i want to do is film about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and she doesn &apos;t do science in particular -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks patients , families , relatives , &quot; how &apos;s it going ?
when people have freedom , everyone is for themselves to do the things that maximize our common good and nobody has to decide for us .
then ms. carr then rejected to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music , and then to have it another possibility , which is an instrument to sound .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very touched by , because many , many beautiful expressions were what i also lived through .
we &apos;re years from being able to improve people , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
you saw it with flu this year , we &apos;re always on the back of it , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
we found one for them , we took them back , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me , the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s , i found a few things .
and if you have that premise , then you understand the logic with which we experience that happiness by a lie we can improve our world .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why can &apos;t you ?
when i look forward in the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create every imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
we were later told that if it went over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth addressing some really familiar brands .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and decided to be individual in the decisions we make .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistakes .
anyway , this will be a more energy carrier , which will be , if you want to know hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or whatever it will be .
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities competing for new residents ?
what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the united states is really about asking about questions about democracy .
and most importantly , i want to tell you that those of you who see this as well just say , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limits is the value of things like the lhc .
dan gilbert did a big point this morning by telling you how much the way we value things depends on what we compare .
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is older one year and a younger sister .
you can see , we surf on the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from page to side , but much more abstract .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of residential , put the laws there would support such a construction and not prevent it .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to evolve ?
we trust that somebody gives us time to do the rules , that we have the same goal , and we remain tied to the end of the game .
it &apos;s only if you take another example , so immediately if you make a bunch of haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and nothing to do .
you can know how satisfaction is someone with their life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach you a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa his life .
and then she said , &quot; next thing i &apos;m going to do is , you will always do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in the trained societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
now , this is good , apart from paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that people should simply stop jamming .
if people took this findings seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on its head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
now , as we go on and look at age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause of worrying about people .
it &apos;s the eager himself who the doctor gets in -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; is it now hurting if i put you in the face ? &quot;
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should , too , because that love story , as romantically , is also ingenuity .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that this ceo is doing , and how much time they spent making decisions that relate to the topics .
it was exprived in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as an alien material , and so we ended up having one cell with a new chromosome .
so , you also see that there &apos;s a change there and then you go from that defense to yes , to the idea that a hundred percent renewable corresponds to this .
you get into that capsule , and then you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t create it yourself .
the second trap is a confuse of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between being happy in its life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom of will can &apos;t be drawn to the action and claims of responsibility , and therefore it &apos;s unaccountable .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich in amazing life as we can &apos;t really imagine .
i &apos;ve been making a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that anxiety was making a typical american in one day is 70 .
and if you want to go over 20 , three percent renewables , so energy per year , not the power at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that means , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , which does as though the opposite of the first sentence already proven and predicted .
and by the way , we go around and circulate and mix up so much that they can no longer tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution to continue .
well , i hope you will agree that players are human resources that we can use in real life to work , and that games have a great meaning for change .
this is a people that &apos;s not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because the celestial scene is comparable to the forest that people depend .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we studied the deep sea .
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 variants on ayahuasca , which you all see at a great distance in the forest that seem like a kind of way to be our eyes .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , let as many people see it as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the kind of thing you &apos;ve done in front of each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , i think they &apos;re not removed at all .
that our system also has a price increase , because we &apos;re not going to make 20 percent of this , and we &apos;re not going to go through a price increase in the other things .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and already , by building phosphorus mining , we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium into the environment than we &apos;ve used in all the nuclear facilities .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build systems right .
and as far as isolation is , if we colonize as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and the environment changes that evolution could naturally produce .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you think now , a director must also lead , a leader must be like a ship quality or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and it completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
and so i sent her home , and i missed a voice in me that was trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so gender is really complicated ; internals are not just in the middle of the gender spectrum -- in a certain way , they can be spread across the range .
and because they work much harder physically than us , and because they live only three to six months , they disagree with their weight , in energy consumption , a little three-billion people .
and from my point of view , the scientific method of trying things is to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements in humanity .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the venice beach , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a jar of marmelade , who they had six to choose than when they had 24 to choose .
but i think , in this frame , here and with intention of making a deception something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle go in there and go from stage .
and because the government ultimately exhausts its power from us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , is going to affect how this change happens .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people , especially if there were a lot of jews in proportion .
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can communicate very well .
what that means is that if you met someone , and you were telling them , oh , your father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spreads from rough , is sort of a grant before the bug is on the institution of government .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future , is the fact that we now have more power than individuals to address the big challenges of our planet .
we now have , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
and what happens is that , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , on climate .
but then another very interesting step in which things became completely different , and that is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities emerged from cells .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable talking to you about it .
if i tell you that someone has ordered their lives as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his life itself .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected links that we form are the real nutritional ground of creativity .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
we all had to do that when we were children read a book , we took the description of the autor and we injected it on our heads .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in self-education .
i spoke loud : you &apos;re listening to thing , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it makes as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about , when it was about explaining the absolutely insane mobility of the creative process .
so it &apos;s now . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever went -- 27 kilometers across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be in the process of creating a new form of cambrian explosion , where there could be massive new species education based on this digital design .
the reason is that , in the past , everything was better than anything was worse than anything was worse was , it was possible for people to experience a pleasant surprise .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed to take several months to plan it , find the different places for the puzzle .
but it also turns out that we use all this time to play , in fact , change what we can do as people .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say , u.s. should spend 10 billion more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here that are zooming up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise .
you have to imagine that if you make something of the classic coupling , you need five hours to take and with this new kind of natural software , you just have an hour .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using nuclear emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
so , in discussions now , these insulanders are always trying to do , they &apos;re doing autark , they have their own little web , and that &apos;s what we have to do with our connection and nothing .
and so we decided to build in berlin a hall where we can sort of map the electrical relationship of the island to one to three very precise .
now , what i hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge field of things , which is wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play games together some kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even negotiated with dr. p. as a five-year-old child , trying to stop these practices , naturally without success .
one of the areas that we see this as a beipiel , in our culture today , in the united states , are fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , electricity generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then we use 20 years .
as you knew in the village , as you know , who has what happens to whom and when , today , is that that going on through this extension of our own devices , through these mobile devices at a global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was acting like that , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
i got a ticket of ticket , because i didn &apos;t go on the bike lane , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive you all the time on the bike lane .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most experimental quantum physicists , who need a good proportion of logic to add the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us a dream of , &quot; i have a dream of speech , &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
at every single step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we &apos;ve tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
unlike the unsolicited conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
and something interesting happened , and that was what fascinated me to jacques cousteaus shows , was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of eliminating the dangers , the others are creating when they &apos;re laying fire .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in the mind of others .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving the people we love to make fortune sleeps , but we also prepare them for getting good with it .
and it turns out that when you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justification used the word because , let &apos;s try and replace it by the word , although replacing it .
i love to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , and to wear , and also , in recent times , too , photographing and blogging .
how about putting the oppressed wherever you are , a voice , to pay attention and to change , for the first time ?
they didn &apos;t count because he stayed with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he &apos;d kept .
and finally , saturday : to develop a unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without saying a word .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is going to scale out , but that it &apos;s growing justice .
and every year , we ask students to create companies , products and services that can be positive in a decade to live on people &apos;s lives .
a process that , as anyone knows , has ever tried to do something -- in other words , is actually everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always keep reasonably reasonable .
i think that in general , molecular biology is now , so generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count to synthetic biology and so on .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and drudding cooperation .
his job is to create conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe began -- up to 600 million times in a second .
that means we &apos;re just projing our vision before we see it , we &apos;re going to bring it back into our seal apparatus , to say , okay .
we &apos;re going to have a process that usually costs 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , learned to know me , she turned into a box full of ash and was laid into my hands .
i personally find it easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
so an organism could learn , for example , not to eat a certain fruit because it tasted bad and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; i &apos;m about creating a life of opportunities .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years on photovoltaics .
the reason i felt worse was because of all these available possibilities , my expectations for what makes a good couple of jeans go up .
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working with uninterrupted for years , sometimes we &apos;ve been back two to three months in a row .
and now you can just do something yourself if you want to test something yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
what they proved was an anatomical concept , and they replaced it by another which was radically and beautiful , and 200 years was accurate for us .
and i was amazed to repel on resistance , to the end of what is the most effective thing in health care history in humanity .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every ad agency we talked to has recommended their clients to keep their fingers from leaving .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to get us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
so what these reactors were a problem is what we put in our filling , and therefore the volume is dramatically reduced during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night -- we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never had before .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues said , but is total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who pay and receive taxes .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of life , but actually , most of the stuff , is the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of the previous ones are wrong , as of course you would have to , take the opposite without proof .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve spent as long as i &apos;ve predicted to reexperience .
but the measuring layers were quite beautiful back , and the people in my company told me that we were not yet able to do that .
well , there &apos;s brands and eight-brands , these things that come and go , but a playful brand , eight marks is a pretty powerful thing .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you speak like this . &quot;
i mean , it can be strange to think about that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
and then we haven &apos;t connected it , but that &apos;s it , i think , has been doing pretty well , people are quite convinced of that .
so again , i was standing with a little team on unknown terrain , and we were turning &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
we need to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into the time machine and go to the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done that .
the congress leader came up onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
so i decided to go to the front of the filialleiter one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer to the people all these options ? &quot;
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventors , the contributors , because this world where we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that they dig , without all the complex .
how do you increase happiness very differently depends on how you think and whether you think of the memories themselves , or whether you think of the life itself .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden of disease and 1.3 percent of health staff .
and then on a weekly day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i might say , maybe i can feel better again .
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly your experience of your child &apos;s football game very different from it .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to form really well .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what &apos;s taking care of you ? let people do what they want .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one , you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this one .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start questioning why we sustain certain separations .
so if we look at the evolution of our society , very briefly here , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation of society or society .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you &apos;re coming from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is skin ? &quot;
that means , from the local village , a global village has actually become a global village with the same principles , as of course , as possible , as well as the total transparency .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , right ?
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pure , if you didn &apos;t believe from the very beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence have come from you .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most feedback , or where i succeeded in the greatest success , are those , where i interacted with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the generation , because , all the time , if you imagine the production , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
you have to separate two things : for one thing to be amputated and another , social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a reminder itself from a lifetime itself , and time has a very little influence on this story .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s the way , people also make mistakes from time to time .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure at home , send it to their doctor and share it with others , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms that make the piece of metal are silent and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
i was proven to be kept on going on , when people came up to me this week just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
they were simply told that be the one-on-one students , and that the students are enough with the note , and the same thing they taught them and treated them .
and as you can see , this is a very inherent area , and you had to sort of navigate from island to island to get food .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward is to actually synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to variate the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and from this soul , you think , somehow in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , anima is in latin , the lufthththell .
today , for the first time -- and the obamas campaign has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
instead of just being quiet there , it was vibrating . the way it was vibrating was kind of like this -- like a stretch and parenting bubble .
and i used this chart to show how valuable rohland is at a place like new york . remember , in some cases , a square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
and if you were to tell the people who exist on the ground , if you said that , that &apos;s better , you weren &apos;t there , they become refined and hostile .
in fact , i was so blurred by self-security that i asked the nurse who was taking care of woman printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay to go home ? &quot;
osit osit is about 50 to 70-thousand times the time we ever have activity , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve realized that it &apos;s then less frequently punished than the day .
so every morning , i jumped on my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , rather than just a little salad today , lucien . &quot;
we all know that interactive media is nonlinear by definition , which includes the linearity reason , and what of course tells us is that we are feeling the linearity today as normal .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered two fonds had a partial rate in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
once the first is done , when it &apos;s walking like promising , everything is very clear , because the economies , the energy diet is as different as we know it .
and they &apos;re not too late to start by starting to figure out if they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that properly use the vocal cords .
and when i say computer games , they &apos;re very likely to have some people happy with some consolation , or that they play with some console in their hand with some kind of console .
it was as if time was standing still and the dancers come through a kind of plot . he didn &apos;t do anything else than he had ever done before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything was putting together .
because of different successes in the light sector , by other autotypes , by new ways of building houses , there are many services where energy , some of the individual services are going to reduce by 90 percent .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy , and monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
when you get more intuitive , then i have to punish and see my little friend here , what does that mean from the perspective of cognitive sergonomy , when is there really something intuitive now ?
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; when you think about why people were so touched by it -- apart from the pocahonan tasmanian story , why were you so touched by the imaging world ?
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan winston , who was the best makeup and creator designer at that time , called digital domain .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and have to overlap them with other 50-letter pieces to build smaller sub-units so that they fit together .
they went away from explanations of supernatural ways , and they proved things like an overnatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very vague concepts of birth law .
unless you &apos;re very short before a cost breakthrough , you &apos;re only funding the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
so , when i look around this room and i see people who have either been successful or are in their way , i want to offer you this memory : don &apos;t wait .
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed to something very true about human character .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject in any given subject to the 21st year of life , we will master it .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t raise you an experience happiness , but lack of money will definitely raise you miserable , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
we should use the efficiency measures to get reductions down the way , the less we emitted , the less the carbon sum , and therefore the temperature will be lower .
in this case , we &apos;ve configure three sitzes as a color pot , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed .
and an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data like shaking color in the way you do it with fluids .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the actual self that decides how happy people are .
without support your husband , she worried for a conversation , bringing him to the court and being smarter in her own case , and an even bigger conversation than she won .
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven from &quot; the greatest movie ever , &quot; the greatest movie ever dreamed of , &quot; a attention from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
do you realize that we can use it and require the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetic ?
now i want you to imagine something that is tragible to a robot that gives you human ability , or another one that helps wheelchair users stand up and walk up .
the u.s. intelligence agency fror two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and in that account , 14.9 million u.s. dollars were frozen .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik michael els-ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were freely slamming the sidewalks off , right in front of those parts .
the terrapower-concept means that instead of a part of uranium , you know , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
if the stupid divine genius that &apos;s put aside decides to show you , for a moment , a brief amount of wonder through your effort , your i.e. , your i.e. !
and so you get an idea of , if you search for this kind of information , target , broader , zoom out , you don &apos;t search or you don &apos;t just browse .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can restrict the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
the dropper is active on the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , even when the special program that tries to infect is running on this target .
but we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to be mentally unstable .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an orthopedic in my hospital had taken off somebody &apos;s wrong leg , believe me i had trouble looking in his eyes .
he &apos;s still going to , because of his earlier stories , associated with the skepticist camp , but he &apos;s understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now making the research argument .
work -- we &apos;re blessed by how carl demonstrated , using technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day from every place on the planet -- all the way to the randolph hotel .
it can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water every day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latin -- all of that for less than two cents a gallon .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . he &apos;s an italamerican whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t correct . so he &apos;s always been called dr. p.
you know , we really have -- moderate targets like the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a main source of energy .
and to be honest , the only real and remaining disability i had to deal with is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
yes , there &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater , 2 percent of it &apos;s gone , and we &apos;re fighting about .5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope here .
it started with a question of the mayor who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public places as part of architecture .
usability always means how can i reach a certain goal as quickly as possible or how can a user in a certain context be able to effectively , efficiently and satisfying a goal .
here in the image on the left , you see bio-curious , which is a hackerspace , basically a kind of school , so private school , a nonprofit mall , where everybody can get .
the transition place is now where these communities are so close together that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into a sign chain on the dna .
but the other thing is , we believe that every day , when we see the cup that we throw away , it doesn &apos;t just disappear that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , then all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and preferred by evolution .
this is the greatest time ever there was on this planet , no matter what scale you are doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper paper paper paper or a newspaper , which is kind of a medium of multidimensional scales .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant we had to make this work happen , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to move our country forward .
well , of course , in a way that accidents remove the debate around the value of science and engineering on such boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
now you could think that the problem with people who certainly lived in predatory societies , killed animals , who only realized a few generations of what they had done .
the little thing we added was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
and then , if that lufththic is poisoning over humans , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
so today , i want to take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a quick journey through the ethnosphere , trying to understand what actually went wrong .
this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same electricity -- 8.8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the coolest part is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it will be -- that april , in the inner city of los angeles , there will be an exhibition called the kind of &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
so , if we go back to the software area , here &apos;s the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
they represent part of the human imagination that are coming back in time past , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are becoming part of the geography of hope .
children , old , all kinds of people , they &apos;ll go there to just sit down with it , they &apos;ve set up a lab and they &apos;ll look at what you can do when these lab protocols are on .
tastemaker , creative communities , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture , where everyone has access and determines the audience of popularity .
if you just believe that you &apos;re a gift -- an inconceivable source for an ingenuity of your life , which is passed on to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
somehow , i have to find a way of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural climbing about how the reaction will be to the writing .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t hear less about sioux than they were doing bows and arrow than americans stopped being an american than they were assigning horses and horses .
she made me realize that telepresence experience that you could use such robotic avatars and your own consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
there is no boundary for technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , limitation and injustice .
and even though you &apos;re all turned off , every minute we watch our child in a football game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
this was dr. kean , a man who i only knew from narratives of my mother this day , because i came to late , of course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks old .
so i came up with the need to just put a check , and instead i set out a check that i didn &apos;t have the easiest idea of how to put it in .
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a fish skin , i don &apos;t like to suck it . i don &apos;t like it crunting .
but it &apos;s this contemplation that this thing we have , and for which we pay , it &apos;s something that works against us , something else , and then we took ourselves out .
and i &apos;m going to play music with nathaniel over and over again , whether in the walt disney , hall or skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
the beauty of this island is that , in fact , on this island , you can take away everything that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
telephones , computers , video recorders , cd-roms , so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information .
there are many businesses that would like to go to america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
maybe the concept that &apos;s going to be right now , which is just looking at what &apos;s broken , and how we repair it , for each one individual , is a greater disability than pathology is .
and the third is concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without distorting its meaning .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being quite well , and we don &apos;t perceive all its forces and possibilities , we also create the natural struggle that you might need to lead , another disease .
we &apos;re putting in games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re taking what we need out of games .
there are also some nice ways to do it in education like languages , mathematics , in logic games , where we want to give people the possibility of fast-step trial and see the results immediately .
the distinction between the happiness of the living self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two separate ones .
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have lots of times , bisexual sex , with changing partners , and rules like that , conflict and social issues .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , you &apos;re seeing an animation of iven coming out of a plant in front of the house .
and there was another nurse saying , not the sister who had seen after woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most emergency doctors i know .
so after the success of titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main profession as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice for a while , and i &apos;m going to be a full-time researcher . &quot;
now , there are also graduate studies to whether you learn it for your use , only passively understands or you can also speak actively , until the musical mother &apos;s language .
i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
they &apos;re not anything but something that they put on in the morning that gives them extra strength , and that will continue to increase their speed , and will help them maintain their balance , for example .
every dollar was given , and they were put into more education in english and mathematics , whatever we had to say , and most of the time , the new things that came out of two hand .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
most people are doing it about a meter , bwl students , half of it , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , kindergarten children are better than adults .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we put democracy out about anatomy -- less about the individual body of mind , thinking about identity , and thinking more about relationships .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as to save in online games .
when you have an environment where adults are doing music , or at least hearing actively music , a child is growing up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does color have your flowers ?
now , the exact relationship between a carbon rise and the results of temperature change , and where the consequences are , there are some unclear , but not very many .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we believe , what causes us to feel real .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any one , every single thousand characteristics of just one second to one species .
so the people who decided to participate more tend to have more opportunities available , the more they rent it and the more fonds they chose it .
that means , aesight , if you know that now , you pay attention to who you look like a long time , because i don &apos;t take a election for what can happen according to it .
so , if we look at that we can transmit existing action models from one to something else , like the metaphor , i can make that gain from one age .
and the wind power plant or the solar system or whatever it is , usually a back-up system is a system , or rather , a system that can only store in small quantities here .
don , i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t pollution the environment . &quot;
but to me , in the realm of interactive media as particularly impressive that we announced by se in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to be bleak quickly , you &apos;re going to look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first hot part behind here .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that could be machine-readable in the future -- could be made visible by fmri ?
so , really exciting processes , which then in this one , yes , gray is not actually , but here we are in this raw crowd according to it .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of content and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
we need to deal with the unstoppable separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
so these communities started moving forward , so that the level where evolution was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community of cell , which we call organism .
now , if you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can see now that the men who may have come to our lives would have come to the quarter us .
now , if we can combine the systems that control the numbers and valves , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
well , after i chose government , i realize that the wikipediakatories , the most frequently report time magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot;
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of images on which you can walk and move through that you can look from many , many , many ways .
and my friends , making big , gigantic hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners they have .
but i bet that playing with the bodder wave taught him a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just let you pass , and that they stay in one place .
so crazy , of course , that might sound like the relationship of my talk , because we &apos;re moving physically into non-existential , virtual worlds , by the way that we look at the holodeck .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s the very question i &apos;ve spent the last few years working at the institute of the institute for the future .
we can watch our kids play at the football , and we have our cell phone on one hand , and our blackberry hip on another , and our laptop probably on our lap .
do i understand it right ? their software allows you to have a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world are basically being linked together ?
i have the impression that if we listen to vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , which means we make vacation , essentially in the service of the memory itself .
and it wasn &apos;t until he turned 19 that he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was internally menstruck that the doctors found that he was female inside .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i was trying to do something with museums and art , and my bofin , who is today , gave me green light .
and we bow around the corner , and we had the most incredible look at , thousands and thousands and thousands of paintbrush flamingos , literally , a pinker carpet as far as the eye would be .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as a job rating after the forgotten success of my last book was right ?
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- that you can just apply in your business .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , i left the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to go home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a brave citizen .
how big would it have to be , in fact , a battery so that you could put an island on 20 , three , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe 70-percent renewables .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because you might be doing something lazy so you can continue eating because you know that you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i study in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better at play than we &apos;re in real life .
play is a shape-changer , and it can take many shapes that some are a little bit more quiet , a mind-boggling , curious -- maybe to rediscover the amazing .
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be afraid of being a chemist .
so here we have a complete parallel education , where young people learn the same way , which means being a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and the reason that we would have been , first of all , through medicine , is to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise selected and taken out of the population .
and in which we gave him a little push , we could actually vibrate it at the same time and not vibrate -- something that is only allowed in the quantum mechanics .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird of quantum mechanics .
we &apos;re hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
and i went back through the same score of shame and self-doubt , feeling frozen and getting tired of work until it was done again and again and again .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power because of the bloodshed bloodline from grandfather to father to son and so on .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people , use the things we design .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of man to survive and thrive is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflict .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just these agonized objects that are made together in a small space .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country writing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities .
