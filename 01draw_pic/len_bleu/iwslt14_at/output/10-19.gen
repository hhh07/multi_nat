it was something we knew how to do .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
my grandmother never left me alone .
you know , science is not a company .
raise your hands . let me see me .
so imagine that just for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
that &apos;s something built in the city .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
your problem is you have too little .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
they were just like the people in this room .
let me show you from the very close .
what we want to do is to create the future .
so just go ahead ; save the shoes .
i think i may have heard more hands .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is it about the details or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and let me show you a simple example .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
anyway , they do it .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go another slide .
our goal was to say , okay .
and in time , they can react to something else .
this one has to go all the way down to zero .
so , help me a little bit .
and then , usually it looks like this .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
can you also play them in blue as well ?
no , we &apos;re going to determine what &apos;s inside .
and the problem is not technology itself .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
here are some more people who test it .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can still revote them .
i think first of all , curiosity is .
that &apos;s what u.s. is doing for hundreds of years .
now , they understood the advantage of prototyping .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
and in that mind , the memory was played .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
and what &apos;s the point ?
in the countries where people come to money .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
how about living longer in good health ?
i have something i want to show you here .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
and the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
why do i have to afford a little car like that ?
he &apos;s just fooling her and not self-conceiving .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence at all .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
so , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure success .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
well , i understand . i do .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
many of you probably know this trick here in the room .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
this is not how happy a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
and that &apos;s not just gender .
here are the results we just got .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
and out of me , a character in the book becomes a character .
i remember it was yesterday .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but not always that bad thing is , either .
this is a two-second time record .
anyway . i certainly want .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left you see a little boat .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
and try it again with another generation .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
and then i wonder : how could this happen ?
the question is , why do people accept it ?
what would you tell someone who believes it ?
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
and they had to take away what we did .
now , they &apos;re all back on their way .
nobody else has done that in the world .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government now .
let &apos;s pretend that we have a machine here .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
and in my work , i learned very simple things .
this is a problem that many players have .
and we need to do a lot of work better .
and now what i &apos;m saying is very important .
actually no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
is i really sorry . is that crazy ?
now everybody in this pattern is trying to see something .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
what happened was that we could do that .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
so i spoke to a conference a few months later .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
the best part is -- one second .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
i hired her and made her treatment .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
and i took a while to figure this out .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is another view of the tree of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
and if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not anything that happens .
think about it . this attack is generic .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
you can look around all these museums here .
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
look , let me give you an analogy .
so he got the citizens to check them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so these women met and just talked .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
so you could probably feel like selling it .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any point about what &apos;s true .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so please listen to the day a music is played .
and that &apos;s the message , you know , that &apos;s the message .
how many would choose to think good ?
so imagine two other small changes .
this is an idea worth spreading .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , go ahead and start inventing .
and we can look at that now .
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
and so my way of making films changed completely .
the second factor is the services we use .
there are some places we can turn to .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with all of you .
and then that &apos;s there , and that &apos;s what comes back .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
so in other words , i define what i want first .
the only problem with it was that she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put in watermarks .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
it &apos;s a refourth shape , right ?
i &apos;m never going to play as much as i &apos;m going to play in that moment .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and at all , you work much less than me .
where is the biggest interest in doing this really ?
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website here .
so , a climate change will get terrible for you .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to be facing .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open up doors themselves .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now , that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but it should be .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
i don &apos;t know who knows about you is this picture .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
and so i then made a slightly unusual decision .
but you know what you &apos;re not right to ?
but one of them is much worse than the other .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
but are we going to make the best out of our play drive ?
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
here we were , and this is the painting .
all right , let me show you a little bit more of that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and that was an experience of humility to me .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
yeah , what are we doing for projects like this ?
they virtualize reality without computers .
and fortunately , there are a lot of studies now .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
and we often reinvent ourselves as we want .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
and the same thing was , after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
there &apos;s a program some of you may know .
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these results have been achieved by a couple of weeks of hard work .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
it also shows up in other places of the book .
and i just went over and i just listened to it .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
same thing , i think , is that we &apos;re going to use games today .
you can say things here that are influenced worldwide .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much like . &quot;
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and we learn the rules of the game , and we learn the rules of the game .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and so it &apos;s not seen as a loss .
if you want to make them hyperlinks between the images .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
i &apos;ve got maybe another 40 years of work inside of me .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
so we &apos;re going to go ahead , and where are we going ?
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
it was &quot; eternity , forever . &quot;
a little bit more about you , not you .
and how was that for you ? what is it successful ?
we &apos;re now far from this goal .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
but actually , that night , it was a bigger fun .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
supply america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
because , you know , it &apos;s a fun process .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miguel .
this was not a movie , no hd , this was real .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re at this museum .
because the images were liking it for them to feel real .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
we see the process that feeds itself .
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
well , because you don &apos;t know it was once different .
it &apos;s called the automatically compelling stone .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course , how design really impacts your perception .
so how does a human being go about certain things accordingly .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photography .
now , we have a political argument in our country .
as it used to be happening in the village , as it used to be .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
ask questions , ask for evidence , ask for evidence .
i know what people think when you see that .
ok , so imagine how extreme self-motivation is .
but we don &apos;t know a little bit about where things go .
there &apos;s more behind it , and it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
and the fish was fortunate to be there .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but what if you want to see the brussels ?
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
and as you can see , these are not three special images .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had an impact .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a big choice .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to ever change .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and we &apos;re still hanging very , very , very strong about stories .
this is the time you fall in love with .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of companies .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
so i &apos;m going to step back and get the perspective .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
25 years from now , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
so i know about some who haven &apos;t been involved .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the tantians .
and then they &apos;ve done a whole lot of simulation .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
and there was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
well , energy has fallen over time .
this is a varied one thing that &apos;s been done .
you can just call it a few names , and people will understand .
they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tabak ?
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
i &apos;ve been filming in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and it &apos;s got olé ! it &apos;s not like anything .
there &apos;s more likely to be my glasses .
because we &apos;re not going to make things free .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
i understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life in my life .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict you yourself .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
the biggest difference between them is the process of time .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
so i say let &apos;s start the world-changing games !
is it available for others or is it affecting us ?
france makes a tor . italy makes a gate .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
well , in this area , there are not thousands of targets .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction about it .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
and these were sort of the first of humans to develop toys .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open doors to you ?
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s educated as a girl .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and alert .
i want to talk about the problem , and some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
it was looked at almost 50 million times this year .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
at one point , the screen fills with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he described one of them as very common .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the remembering self .
in both cases , they did surgery , and they did well .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
no , throw it away is exactly the right thing , right ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can flip that around .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
now , how do people die in the aftermath of such hacks ?
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
that &apos;s why you think about how to weigh .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
1m is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my last .
both of them nailed me , they asked me .
i can &apos;t play as much as i can do in 20 years today .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
so when it says , there &apos;s no soul .
many people speak of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
we were albering around there just like we were .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
when we start thinking about it , this is how it changes everything .
and in the course of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
this is starry night , probably never seen that way before .
our steps in digitizing life were exponentially .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . it &apos;s not an extension line .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the checkout .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital that &apos;s the physical .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really believe that something else comes after us .
now it &apos;s in the red list of dangerous species .
we had no words for what we started there .
in the future , most crimes will be playing online .
the life itself has no voice in that choice .
you don &apos;t know anything that &apos;s possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to resolve in a moment what &apos;s inside .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
this constant feedback is not true in life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
we know another one where everybody is .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
it has eyebrows of life , one by one .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wanted to think i could see my children grow up .
and what we realized was that i needed an expert .
now , where would you positioning your brain at this scale ?
cats look at cats looking at this video .
the software coverage usually takes a few years to get it .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
we need to be in the government machine system .
the cost of solar energy has dropped by 50 percent last year .
i sent her home without talking to my superintendent .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
how many doors does the house you live in ?
and other ones are the ambitious , smart systems .
but also , our perception of ourselves , how disappointed it to us .
so you help with that , ask people what ?
i &apos;m explaining to you what these sounds might mean .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negotiating with the insultants .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
any of the more of a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they did it by disposing the country .
so the device that you see there has not worked .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be in your own right .
the things that are only used are going into technical systems .
and as i turn around , the finger changes its position .
are you there ? you look a little nervous .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
so , if you could turn the light back on , please .
it &apos;s impossible to say , &quot; well , this photograph is actually put together . &quot;
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and i think it &apos;s a worried that the world looks like this .
i apologize that i have to cut so much down .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting in vision .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s losing half of his value in the first year .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit curious .
and most of all , it &apos;s to ask what the right thing to do .
because the music is a language , and a language is for communications .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
we &apos;re going to face a few more times in the next few days .
what it had ruined was the memories of experience .
we think about our future as being predicted memories .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s happening inside .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s going to rape about 120 feet out of water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
that keeps us able , and we &apos;re moving forward and forward and forward .
the epiphany is , death is part of life .
the pilot ran the machine after the hudson river .
i &apos;ve not argued with my wife for two years anymore .
so the driving force behind it is cyber superpower .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
and what we found was that there was actually a context .
the words , as long as his friends , were spooking his .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
when we looked at how feelings varied with income .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
i would argue that we are ready for our own epic game .
again , what potential do we want to call out ?
which would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if it stopped moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
the example that i showed you was finding details .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i started thinking , well , i should just invent the project .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i went home through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves from themselves .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of our eyes .
i knew she had come to pass .
today , we &apos;re not just finding pleasure in something we &apos;re doing with it .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 products today .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so here i want to present to you two , maybe three examples as well .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to witness a rolling iceberg .
this is someone who &apos;s surely met four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve been used to things being linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a mandant .
in it , they want to be in there , they want to get to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat it , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
the more money you make the happier you are .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to make it .
and the oil is going to replace it with other energy carriers .
and also , what you would think of today in the mind .
and then i get in immediately , and that &apos;s unfair .
so the more pink the gut the system . &quot;
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because they are the ones who are experts in flavor as well .
so better there should be a nine in my death row at the beginning .
these are many deaths from masses , 20 per hour .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
but it turns out that &apos;s not all that yet .
i hope you &apos;re very happy to do that . thank you very much .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
just that i think it likes him , right ?
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the film of statites .
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yes , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , this is someone who is completely logical .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
that all of our survival is linked to each individual survival .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
i mean , how much will we honor our memories ?
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
imagine those images could really start flying .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
open up the map , and jump with a click .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing real estate .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money to the animal &apos;s catcher , it costs a lot of money .
what is this new state that the world is starting to take on ?
in fact , we are also such a multi-cellular community .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do injustice .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . heartfelt wish .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be manly .
you know , there were no mandarines in paradise .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
each of these topics , of course , was made up of many , many smaller decisions .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
a few months went on , and i just forgot everything .
so , depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and the result was that the phone had never been broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity for a long time .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry us .
so this is the same , bad team , one under the best .
how can we transmit these feelings from the games into reality ?
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people to happy .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
and of course , in germany , it can &apos;t be given it anymore . &quot;
this is what they &apos;re all in the pre-wind phase , as a matter of fact .
now , where should we go ? what &apos;s the right approach ?
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , although that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more force .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
it was completely closed , that it could fail .
then they wanted to kill them , because they were good food .
but if you &apos;re in an external country , you can see that .
somewhere here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is the audience that we just recently completed .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
we &apos;ve moved in the avian age that we call the bird age before .
i can say the canceller is a man .
a very concrete wish that we &apos;re inventing this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
well , your life of self is not going to get happier .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve been receiving all sorts of recognition .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive fallings .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it for this morning , &quot; he said .
and they were taking the lights through the rest of the book .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a bat hits 300 .
and all the time , i was collecting more knowledge .
i studied woman printers , and she was in breathing .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
now i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
we &apos;ve been in holland now in about three years .
yeah , this is what it sees at the bottom there , you know , that load .
and immediately , i see another pattern that surrounds you .
so that really flipped me around , and i wanted more .
this goes back a lot more , into the pre-industrial cultures .
this airport alone has a 100 square kilometers area .
turned the trash ton to the side . went home .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of us .
well , in fact , the number of crimes has not changed very much .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
finally , a solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
this really only took about two thousand really eight shapes , these networks .
i think , kind of , six dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very promised hack .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
and six million seconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle or sing a song anymore .
and from that time , an anecdote you may know .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-neutral .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
now , the life itself lives continuously .
well , the two types of self are two terms of happiness .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
it means that we have reached a cultural impact besides the scientific impact .
six of the speakers : social decline . speakers 7 : 65 deaths .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
and they did it with what we call a leadland map .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
okay , let me squeeze some blood for you a little bit of blood .
imagine that every single one of people is being controlled .
and guess what we found in the code of attack ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict even ?
but instead of cranizing in panic , he just stopped .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had in the last half of the year .
but somehow , we can get away from this problem .
he invited the king of siam to the dinner dinner dinner .
this hit me when i wanted to share my jeans .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
so i &apos;ve been looking at when is natural or intuitive .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
i ate it first in a south spain restaurant .
what about paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate a strong government . we have no trust in the system .
we &apos;re putting in games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we degrade a human being worth doing our society .
we &apos;ve got his bed strapped so that he can see outside .
here &apos;s a piece of data from this code of attack .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you should do a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
why is it important to start new ? what is the red ?
an eight-eight , posted brand . how &apos;s your brand ?
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome the fear .
so a few years ago , i went to do exactly that .
opportunities that have not been allowed have been explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish had been taken on a smoke trip .
so there are programs that are the most common of the marriage can be .
in many areas , people were afraid of lynchmobs .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
how about a sentence of new , never heard before .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i gave an introduction to the lhc at the last ted conference .
and then we worked on a code-of-conduct like this .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
that means you navigate through sound and rhythm .
the notes notes , in doing so , have the function of the letters of a script .
and i ask , how skillfully competent was this diagnosis ?
this is a fish elevated in the southwestern corner .
it &apos;s renewables , as they are called often .
the smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
i brought in seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
so it turns out to be very difficult to look at all these extensions .
the biggest fear was they were scared of pirape and death .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much more riding road .
somebody had broken in , and they had hacked the system thoroughly .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re controlling all the minerals .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
there , in my opinion , was a very good code .
the interesting thing is , if i can take a little trip .
the composer becomes increasingly a friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not as sure they really stay here .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is actually the actual human and machine melting .
a couple . probably about as many as creative people are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of each on the planet .
i grew up with a wooden portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensive , not intense .
so here finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and within a few years , lego went went into every household .
here i &apos;ll expand something . we look right here at the center .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to become more diver .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points of image , i think .
fireflies in a glass , i always found really exciting .
from my point of view , i looked up and down at the janitors .
and many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player certainly beats three out of 10 .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
so today evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
sometimes i lose balance . a story to the end .
i want to finish with a story that really got me excited .
because we &apos;re essentially restoring the past through marine protected areas .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
if we overdo it , we can shrink a little bit back .
when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the floor .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
most people usually start orienting themselves in the task .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do it .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the inheritance itself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
this is an amazing adventure you &apos;re going to go to .
think of this as a picture , as a flying spot .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one to talk to the airman .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
almost like we prepare for our lives for a long time .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just like that .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on their own .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is going very fast .
they add a blue one to a green one , and they can make light .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i supposed to do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it would be like a thorny train out of air .
i look like i &apos;m writing a song like i &apos;m writing up ?
so if i put them aside , it makes them interest .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , for example , the environment , drives less car .
we all have to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
again , in each store , you can get things back .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum is all , lots of ideas .
you can like to test it after my talk in your room .
it &apos;s a question of , can you get this to zero ?
has one person in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
most of you are completely ignored by the remembering self .
so you can ask : how happy is the life itself ?
if the museum has given us the picture , they click on it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
and i don &apos;t mean , necessarily , a technical definition of the platform .
i want to help you to make a very particular aspect of curiosity .
they now have a five-percent renewables in the order of 15 percent .
but while you &apos;ve been talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we produce androgen , and we talk about androgens .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty much a bite .
let &apos;s jump to moma quickly , again , in new york .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
who want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
and i thought , it &apos;s so hard , so painful .
this is technology support innovation that &apos;s out there today .
and the best part is perhaps what we &apos;re expecting in health .
but the question i want to throw is : why not ?
you feel that &apos;s the truth behind the arrival .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
you &apos;re usually just standing wrong , and some people don &apos;t .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s supported .
they spend a lot of their time in the assembly of growing structures all the time .
the first of these drops is a resistant desire to admit complexity .
bonobos are all our nearest living relatives with chimpanzees .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
i don &apos;t know how people are going to be recipient .
here &apos;s a evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
ceos is a little bit about average . but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
innovation , creativity , development is not just coming from our heads .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
we think we can think of diginotar as the one .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
this is an entire book , an example of non-imaging data .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
and then the same thing as happens in a good , friendly conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what pille he should do today first .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexuality for that .
i mean , what does anybody bring in with so many outfits ?
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
i really like your kind of sergey brin . well .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
they don &apos;t even come from museums , i think .
car color , outcolor of the car -- i have 56 options .
he said , &quot; there is no death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
the less i think about it , as it were , the more intuitive it is .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful at all .
when your work flew -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
all the parties , all the questions of society , supported this .
how good are you thinking are you in trying to make decisions ?
okay . everyone who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
we can better deal with more categories than we can deal with more choices .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
it brings pictures and text together , animation , sound and touch .
sometimes these ideas are going to rush ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
bryan , they really brought a string to swing .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
because there &apos;s something waking , which has kind of gone missing .
and this is one of the three main sources of the world that we have today &apos;s online problems .
beyond the simple play , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice .
keep on there for your contribution , whatever it wants to be .
and the proposal was to build a lot more coal-fired factories .
i wrote down four words a day , and i &apos;d like to explain them briefly .
and to look at how we process information , how do we record information ?
the meaning of the letters is that when you can understand the language .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery , you can see .
i said , &quot; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish in our fish .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and we became a 4.5 year period of age to a real family .
and that &apos;s a thought i think is a reasonable approach .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are inconvenient .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
we know something about what the happiness of happiness itself determines .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
now why do i challenge my audience to listen to actively ?
and as i say the word justice , that unpleasant feeling is gone .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
big data is being transformed for organizations around the world into big opportunities .
before i finish the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
you would agree with him freely to shine up when it snips .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
they &apos;re new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
if you do review and never do anything about it .
what you need is an environment that will put it in the position .
he finished the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
and that &apos;s then firing under the headquarters of open knowledge and citizen science .
the essential tool of information information information has been ever been stories .
and we can get it right now in this way that we can get nutrients back in agriculture .
to keep twins right with the composer .
you &apos;re basically learning how to read first before you just talk one word .
if i &apos;m not right , the chancer is not a man .
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis , and you know what ?
a deception becomes something that &apos;s true because someone perceives it that way .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re about telling stories .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered from both of them ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than it was for b in memory .
in our views , we were forward-looking areas of inconvenience .
they knew every bits and bytes that they had to attack .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to waste itself .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
we type , we rich in , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
he liberated us from one of the worst humankind minds .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as we are in play .
they are people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
if we look ahead , this kind of change will be increasingly possible .
but it wasn &apos;t until i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
tell me about why phase -- what is it that brings us ?
so quantum mechanics says unmoving objects feel the same .
he asked octavio to become his steady .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the chairman of our country ! &quot;
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; of youtube .
photographs where you have to think for a brief moment to figure out the trick .
and they developed great apps , working with urban staff .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
by 2020 , we &apos;re predicting two to five billion internet users .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the mature reef ? &quot;
you might think he was chasing fins , but that &apos;s not true .
and at the end , they just want to get the poorly overremnant .
this shows the enormous role that a marine reserve can play .
it shows you precise what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just experts .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then you tend to hire it .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years to do it .
so how are we going to ask the question of the properties of character ?
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
in the meantime , i prepared for a talk at tedglobal .
each one of you could be famous by the internet to the next saturday .
and today , we all feel ourselves as owners of our pop culture .
the smells came from the hurdles from the rest of the world .
but it &apos;s actually completely composed of this image , from photographs of different places .
and not even like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
and these apps let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
today , we can point to dozens of companies who have done this .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and it &apos;s me .
the reason for that is , the government could track where a text came from .
listen consciously , and tell them whether they taste or not .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : it &apos;s a bold .
this quest led me to the ancient greece and the old rome .
and that &apos;s the core issue of biohackers .
but now , not at the local level , but at a global level .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground , first of all .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take nutrients .
