sounds familiar , what ?
we can do that .
i &apos;m interested in that .
lento , slowly .
yeah , good day .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going on .
this is the system .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
the farm is incredible .
may i be honest ?
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s great important .
it &apos;s a crisis .
what do you say ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so that one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
it has sensors .
here &apos;s the video .
they &apos;re all important .
hide them .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
completely inefficient .
wonderful , ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
that &apos;s me .
incredibly exciting .
very different term .
okay . thank you .
it &apos;s essential .
so they &apos;re al .
and she did .
thank you very much .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good work ! yes !
yeah , good day .
they have similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
yes , milliseconds .
all the environmental debate .
how interested you are .
that &apos;s a wish .
bg : thank you .
not very often happens .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
how do we know that ?
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
you can go in there .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
so they knew everything .
so how does this work ?
they use their hands .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
what do these people need ?
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
so let &apos;s see .
they trigger . &quot;
so they do that .
players aren &apos;t sitting around .
i was facing him .
let &apos;s call it don .
you could see manhattan .
it &apos;s generic .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
but you know what ?
what happened here ?
centers were built .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
reevaluate it .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
and i was an artist .
not guilt management .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
what is media today ?
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
yeah , it &apos;s done .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to pick up .
home , where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does that sound good ?
the sun goes up .
fantastic , right ?
long , yeah .
the only chance .
yes , so to speak .
thank you . thank you .
that was incredible .
three out of 10 .
stephen watts .
thank you .
no hospital either .
it &apos;s terrible .
you need time .
that &apos;s us .
a few .
and he says ...
we know that .
da-da !
stop twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s fast .
i don &apos;t know .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
after a week .
from seattle ...
that &apos;s singing .
but it &apos;s done .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
this is not ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
60,000 .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
positive .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
ol√© !
maybe not .
thank you .
unique .
thank you .
fine .
suck .
sustainable .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
just about it .
one ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s true .
is that going on ?
well , yeah .
this is what you &apos;re doing .
seriously .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
really .
yeah .
okay .
thank you .
yeah !
creativity .
yes ?
yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
here we go .
yeah .
yeah .
yes ?
thank you .
why ?
fantastic .
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
about that .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
hello !
wow !
again , here you have it again .
what is this thing ?
this was about christmas .
so why now hacking ?
so it &apos;s the n circle .
does it make you curious ?
because you can train this .
and what did that feel like ?
my wife told me .
this is a natural thing .
it &apos;s kind of like , you know .
thank you for your attention .
i loved only two .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
they want to feed the world ?
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
the same thing , just the same thing .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and finally , epic meaning .
but the key thing is , ...
very scary .
remote technology .
they called me .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
what happened there ?
and then they set up .
and he works like this .
so that &apos;s the good news .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
how about fitness ?
these changes are in the coming .
one place is south korea .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
the answer is yes .
you could have done better .
it was just not invented yet .
and it &apos;s the crux .
the answer is no .
so let me remind you .
is that reasonable ?
that &apos;s god , you know ?
this is a game out .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
pattern recognition should work .
well , i was the next one .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
they always say , why ?
there &apos;s no problem at all .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
so they saw something magical .
it was a huge success .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
but they do the job .
sometimes i push too much .
first extension , second extension .
they saw the big impact .
and then everybody went down .
i was terrified .
that was the beginning of the journey .
but it was very sad .
and that worked very well .
this is very risky .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plussignature .
this is a picture of this place .
think about your own decisions .
okay , there are a couple .
her mother would stop her alone .
they connected these two people .
tell me about this world .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
why not think about it that way ?
you see that at the bottom .
you also have to understand that .
most of you know this .
we need to spread the message .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
it sounds crazy , right ?
will it be my size ?
his name is tempt .
what do i look at ?
i find that fascinating .
i find that fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
i want to ask you something .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can say everything .
what is the soul ?
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll end now .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds sober .
we were 20 people .
we &apos;re too many with that .
you can &apos;t have bones .
it &apos;s kind of like that .
or is it possible ?
conflict comes from creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
he went up and down .
we love technology and creativity .
it would be unknowless .
we &apos;re always bumping up .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
i mean the soul .
i created one .
first , narrow .
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
what creates the illusion ?
and so did it .
very expensive real estate .
and i always had .
does anybody see anything in particular ?
give pee a chance .
but that &apos;s not protection .
luckily not , yes ?
in china , it was different .
you do comparison .
yeah . all right . all right .
what would everything have to be done ?
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and why is that ?
i agree with you all the time .
yeah , here it is .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
dk : 60,000 .
i think more than that .
some people have come and gone .
ooh , thank you .
am i going to like the color ?
it &apos;s against justice .
thank you .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
thank you for listening .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i wonder .
i swear it .
it feels great .
i propose children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
the game is 2007 .
there &apos;s no food .
an incredible challenge .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but it didn &apos;t .
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
thank you very much .
here you see it .
but it gets worse .
jk : both .
put out the camera .
... invent his own story .
it would be intolerable .
crisis . death . disaster .
and many people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he always pointed out here .
it was still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are criminals online .
privacy must be given .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be discouraged .
here you see the city .
how do we actually work people ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
but where are we useful ?
the work of interpreting .
that &apos;s pretentious .
let &apos;s call it don too .
but what do your fish eat ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
first , we have the population .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
now , what do you think happened ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
it &apos;s not our problem .
good day , everybody together .
he loved it very much .
she did secretly .
and it got better .
it &apos;s an almost identical structure .
is that your opinion too ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is amit .
just keep going . lots of fun .
the answer to that is no .
okay , a few more .
there was remixes .
let me summarize it .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
i &apos;ll never forget .
it has billions of those .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it even photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ooh .
and then it became international .
so she was back .
and i kept working .
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
what do you want to do ?
let me tell you .
oh . a moment .
why does this happen at all ?
we need energy miracles .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going in here .
or bombs .
but i kept working .
not toxic in it .
you see it immediately .
here &apos;s an example .
this is a child game , right ?
this is like talking learning .
have you ever been tired of that ?
i shoot something through my head .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and then we said , okay .
so i just started playing .
and so the dynamic really changed .
so , look what happens .
so the correlation is low .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
what about longevity ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
the game starts -- silence .
and this video is real time .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
because to me , it means memory .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
all adults were aware of the risks .
it spreads rapidly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
it &apos;s not being documented .
they sell certificates .
and there are several reasons for this .
we started it 15 years ago .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
i find them disgusting .
just be who you are .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next , nuclear energy .
that sounds scary .
that &apos;s frightening .
hmm , my brand ?
let &apos;s leave that quietly .
this is completely trivial .
nullemissions , yes ?
but we need to get that overall .
but it &apos;s effective , right ?
the motivations of writing it .
now i tried something more exciting .
dark urine . dark .
what is a story about ?
i remember my first fire .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
what else is risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you very much for your patience .
her family gathered together .
and his answer was yes .
this is how you can do something like this .
do you want to protect jeans with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
and that &apos;s really the beginning .
anyway , not to navigate .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we say sustainability in germany .
how and what did he feel ?
but maybe this is not the case .
but the truth is far from it .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like beautiful clothes .
you see something fun here .
apparently it was quite popular .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measured its movement .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
something got a bit stiff inside of me .
oh , my time is already over ?
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they are an inspiring personality .
the book and the picture .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is full of great statistics .
i don &apos;t take the same process .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
they were genetically expressed .
privacy is not the debate .
lego made it possible for all of you .
our magazines are read by millions .
a has these benefits and risks .
these rivers are rapidly taking over .
this is the memory basins .
here he &apos;s leaving the sun open .
it was a pretty fate project .
i &apos;d like to show you that .
do we really want to go this way ?
this picture reminded me of something .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
we can get our nutrients back .
this is the minimum of the moment .
you can show , i was there .
if you get up , right ?
that &apos;s what the age difference has to be .
and still , it &apos;s not an interpretation .
so the first step to an interpretation .
you know what is tired ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
how far do you get to this ?
music is medicine . music is changing us .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
i stop this , thank you very much .
you can do it all the time .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re going to be irresistible .
but what will come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
it has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
they flew the channels .
i was absolutely trying to work normally at that time .
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do it simply .
so i went to the court .
i was scared of technology .
doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
she shares her experiences with others .
my name is brian goldman .
he actually collected fish .
it was my first sunburn .
people were still happy .
let them be alive . &quot;
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
we &apos;re dependent on two countries .
and we &apos;re going to pick it up .
so , not like detox .
if we have the waste , right now .
an autistic student .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
and here &apos;s the picture .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
she was back and forth in the dying .
i almost never cook with it .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
what should our testimony look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
take nothing but granted .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
nobody said that ever before .
the data is always showing .
they have so much uncertainty .
they create an epic story .
which would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and he again showed him jafour .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can do that .
how many people would choose creativity ?
is this all ineducation ?
now , how could that happen ?
play is not silly .
the data was not available before .
you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the power plant can explode .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from artists .
but i &apos;m not buying anything new .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
well , then we want to .
what happened that day ?
the story is not over yet .
no had never been an opportunity .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but it &apos;s not that fast .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and that made me really sad .
it &apos;s not our burden .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i learned everything memorized .
that would have not been a problem at all .
this has the biggest impact .
there should be other things not suffer from that .
and then realizing it .
because does anybody here have masses ?
they become free to computers .
this is about five meters long .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
my second mistake was worse .
one time , we started a vibrant .
okay , it really does courage .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the shape plays a role .
what lessons have we learned ?
further than that , we don &apos;t go .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
slowly but surely , it laid down .
they get more and more similar .
because i can say everything .
this is all metadata .
we use the energy of the sun .
i &apos;m going to stand you something .
and it starts with a doctor .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
asked the nurse sachonically .
it &apos;s all easy to have today .
creativity had to somehow get out .
the white lines are for population .
in the morning , before the game .
italy wins . yeah .
the whole building was made of water .
they can play with different kinds of ways .
and then something funny happened .
what other brands are like this ?
so this is one of the images .
basically they do the same thing .
and then we did .
we &apos;ve gone to an area .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
that was grandios .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
but , but you know what ?
i started feeling better .
but there are two problems with this .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
so the question is : how ?
and we &apos;re too many .
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
it just doesn &apos;t technologically do that .
he pointed to the algae .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we can support them to be good .
but with the right design , please .
the mechanism is from lying .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
we also got very accurate data .
this is going to happen in april next .
he shake his head , no .
it was really incredibly profound .
we &apos;re talking about it in twenty ways .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i think is .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
i read to you the input .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
the main man winked me up .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
we can support them to be good .
and women did succeed .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
the roof was also covered with water .
this is a painting of a circle .
this is usually not the route .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
we talk about the kitchen , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
there was jimmy kimmy drum coming .
even cats look at this video .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
i believed everybody could .
that i had written these crazy things .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
he turns off the engine .
... so , not so optimistic .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
politely , everybody applauded .
now we saw the reverse effect .
he pulled back into silence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked late to night .
so scott gets this fruit .
maybe lead some mutations .
they kept us inspired by this .
i impersonated people in death cells .
it might take you to get it invited .
now look at this curve .
we go through initiation rituals .
you &apos;re the countries of someone &apos;s home .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re all engaging questions .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
we have to get far , fast .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
so from modern into computer society .
you see , you know , from the back to the front .
a dalmatiner , right ?
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
and that was the outbreak of it .
it &apos;s not even the truth that &apos;s going to free it .
we have masses in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
there &apos;s also a role in dosage .
everybody would like to make people happier .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and there are quite a lot of employees .
so the first exciting primate .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
conditions of this species don &apos;t exist with us .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
it &apos;s called &quot; springs with me . &quot;
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
does anybody know what that is ?
so , tempt is now fully paralyzed .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
tell me a little bit about that part .
you can be logical and intuitive .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
and i &apos;d like to read them to you .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
i lived in parallel worlds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let go . &quot;
the bank is from a different place .
this is a modest little app .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center in boston .
so there &apos;s a feedback plumbing .
it can know how we hold it .
i learned a few very simple things .
to say alone , what &apos;s information ?
something very strange is going on here .
you should also wish for them .
what are these three billion people going to bring to us ?
we expect an extraordinary couple of decades .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
but i kept asking myself about those questions .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
she was not drowned yet .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
156 nations send our television channel .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , no , missing far .
maybe again , have to look back at it .
odds are simply part of our lives .
i see the dalmatiner .
what does five million seconds take ?
the thing that &apos;s just been presented .
this is a commissioned part .
you put a boss there .
the chef had cook it .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is an environmental network .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
and also , these sources are interrupted .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it do ?
and even lomborg thinks about it .
there was never a time like this before .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
what do you think happens next ?
tell me what you feel .
they drilled through each other .
here you see how the building works .
completely set on a particular goal .
he died , broken through the story .
it will touch it deeply .
you lose rare animals always .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
this sounds basically unusual first .
so there are two circles .
especially when he died .
i hope you forgive me .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
they literally moved the lever around .
it &apos;s been consistent so far .
so this is a tough foot .
they have them . they always have them .
the byproduct is clean water .
it &apos;s about changing normal .
i started with my usual talk .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
but it requires a lot of planning .
who would ever wish ?
the defeat would have been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
for one year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .

and the goal here is quite simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .

who don &apos;t want to be healthier children ?
we won a few prizes .

we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
i call this the luminous tiger .

we need to think about which brands .
the movie hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
they even bring in funding .
here &apos;s the olive oil going .
who do you really want to inform ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could have done all this ?
i talked a lot about magic .
and that got me so confused ...
my brother stared at me .
this is perhaps being broadcast public .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of procedures .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .

but the reality is always unpredictable .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
it sums up thousands of square kilometers .
third technology : categorization .
my fourth technique : requirement for complexity .

this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
motors , motors , gear -- four possibilities .
nobody has to give green ideas .

we &apos;ve been asking , and nobody knew .
and there &apos;s a central point in there .
now , everybody &apos;s eaten cake .

a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
and then he can walk away .
because now they can use a three-sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
bad ? i was completely confused .
and what do you do with the waste ?
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
