and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
and so i started playing around , and i realized something was going on there .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
and this is what got us thinking about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
i think the genre , the style i have is probably dark glamour .
with so many options you can choose , people are very difficult to decide at all .
then they only use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind where they live .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
that &apos;s going to lead the patient to suffer , but just a little bit less than before .
people are in the process of recognizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone understands .
it &apos;s changing over time . it &apos;s changing , because for people , their actions are completely natural .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the open sky , and i tried .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into business and ask that question .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria just as important for their lives .
in the good ones like evil , and in the old days as you might think , these decisions are going to be about us .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hotter in this place . there &apos;s no thing .
more than anything , everything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father .
just tell me a little bit about how it is connected to your thoughts and feelings about it itself .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is we want to share with you a quick video .
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone here today is , is this idea for you to be perfectly okay ?
the question i ask you , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
and then you would suddenly realize what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
extremely important now is extremely important , and much , much more important in the future .
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes tomorrow .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of both kinds of self .
think about a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
what i have to say to myself all the time when i get crazy is , don &apos;t fear .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
now , we know from that study that you have to reach the needle when you have to go to the thing .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so that we can predict the development .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- i &apos;m really blown out of the socks .
we need to prevent people from acknowledging things , especially when they &apos;re true .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
and like many people , i thought the government was mostly about choosing people in office .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s suffering us is our imagination .
so i &apos;m basically going to talk about this : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
make ways to use them easily and start humiliating patients in the team .
and so , from the interest of this technology , i went on and on .
and that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to what you really want to be a gesture .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
i thought , &quot; do you put the camera out &quot; mean we wanted to have a backup conversation .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than it is today .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is presented .
and i &apos;d like to say to you , please , that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the job today .
and what we can now read in the newspaper almost every day , you &apos;ll find in that third sentence .
we &apos;ve got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress the earlier .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games together to survive on this planet another century .
or are we going to be something else -- something that may even be better adapted to the environment ?
just to give you the overview , i &apos;m going to zoom out so you can see what you get .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and the next piece is about four generations of women in three generations together building a new life .
and what we actually did , we , the human being , is we started abstracting .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
and this was an example of how our own governments use technology against us , citizens .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
for her , life had challenged her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight we &apos;re all struggling to talk about who is going to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and power that it wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
because obviously , an animal that has been very common will rarely die out before it dies out .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there probably wasn &apos;t a defeat in her treatment .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another until you get to your first million .
now look at what happened that day , just when you watch activity that happens in the network .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not like it &apos;s on .
is this something that you can participate in , because you have a few minutes left on ?
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building than they &apos;re worth building .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but these articles were worried to me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i figured it out .
you &apos;ve probably heard of &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 starches , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types challenging social norms .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is mentioned so many times today .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone can deal with it , are two different things .
it was about a method that parents can find out which are the right public schools for their children .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard of before will become global communication .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer the way they were .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the same way we saw it before .
so i started thinking about what it is that we make these games master .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever they are .
all these photos are being connected together , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and then , if you make good shots , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it is that government is not the same as politics .
we &apos;re going to point out , for example , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna in common with chimpanzees .
so many people now have in the world , at least one hour per day with online games .
well , let &apos;s go to the end that we have to get to , and then let &apos;s talk about the intermediate step .
you have to go up and go to the fire , and this woman has to get some shoes . &quot;
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right to his mind , even a right to his mind of progress .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically go forward , you get about six , the stable structures .
perhaps that &apos;s exactly the sense of adversity , a sense of icons , a sense of our own power .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they cost .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
they live in a world that has transolete information and communication , as no one could ever predict .
and when i come , with my little v w piesel and i &apos;m just imagining , this feeling comes up .
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a million chance .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because people are pushing to work very quickly .
so the performance of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams work .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the trash as it goes through the system .
and every time i interviewed someone , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so that , as citizens , you &apos;re able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
because the soil is just going to die , the mosses will die , and the wind will , and the water will wash away the ground .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when they think about their lives .
so the idea is that we actually involve people with things together , collectively .
well , there &apos;s an epiphany that &apos;s usually something that you find because you drop it somewhere .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
you can go and create your own museum online -- all these pictures , you can put your own collection out of it .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m treated as if i was refused to the outcome .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a little bit of a future away .
but not only that -- merging and connecting with that , you know , with the universe and other devices out there .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and adapt at the same time .
and yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the erects .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with when the process is pushed out .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic outcome .
and every time it divided , they have found chemicals spread to the same amount .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken by the mind . how can you be harmed ?
so , people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a moment have missed a lot of biology .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to be able to communicate into the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them to where we want to .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
but the challenge is to try and figure out which ones are and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the following .
please help us do that , and try to not just improve health , but take your hand .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we see , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
maybe you can stand up for a second so you can pause with the two over the project .
well , i don &apos;t like that question because it &apos;s been the logic of our food system that &apos;s been deciding for the last 50 years .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles from the next ocean .
it &apos;s actually so firmly sitting in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are and what we have to do .
so he says that this actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all that still in their hands can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
some of you may have heard that a couple of weeks ago i turned on an ad on ebay .
that , suddenly , i think , is becoming increasingly important to success , just the usability is going to be an application .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this away now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world that we &apos;ve seen to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , unless we say we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area as well .
and so it &apos;s also so strong inside us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
today we want to talk about how video is viral , and then finally , why it &apos;s important .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s worried about the details of how to do it .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for aquatic conditions .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse shot of what happened over the last 25 years .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the topic , which , of course , lies behind , is usability .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact , more important than anyone on the planet .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we make them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seven-team and prime minister at the same time .
and through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
then , one day , he came back from walking and he said , &quot; dad , my legs crypt . &quot;
of the people who were standing there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people two and a half months .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used very often recently is evolution itself .
the first example is predicts what many of you know and some of you , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
so just that kind of thing comes out of the words that we use over and over and over again in the language of political correctly speaking .
but these concepts of cyberage , which bring us these possibilities back to our ability to rediscover our ability .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more of my personal cause to play it .
but there &apos;s no clues that we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
this is like , if i said , your child , instead of five times .
it turned out that it really meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with their movie . &quot;
and it &apos;s about solving a problem with a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first ones to be the fourth generation fuels , and in about 18 months .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , and we had the code for america program .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with it , that they fake themselves .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together and correcting the mistakes .
we &apos;ve managed to get about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
now , morgan , on behalf of transparency , what happened to the $ 7100 ?
are we using these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , that &apos;s more successful , that &apos;s more friendly ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your descendants ?
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
this is also the entertainment value of this speech , so i hope you enjoy it .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i only got two years later to face when we moved to california .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ourselves ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
so we relist our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i admired my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and i have to make this crazy case .
if i &apos;m going to go into a room -- like i just got no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
and so many people also come and they look at this , just because you can see what problems you get .
i was assure you didn &apos;t bite me , and in fact , you &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that change things ?
our memory tells us stories , which means that we can keep our experiences from a story .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since i &apos;ve got to say , it &apos;s been very successful .
so to me , photography seemed to be more about being at the right place at the right time .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve been missing that point for a long time in choosing our common good .
as peter told us , they &apos;re not only producing the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately , but this is going to happen , and this is what &apos;s happening right now .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the success of the scientific method .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
so if you want to maximize the luck of both species of self , you &apos;re going to end up doing very different things .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could do b .
immediately , they &apos;re going to be one for , of course , such predictant , and you can &apos;t prove that .
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
but here &apos;s what it is : if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
i want to explain to you today about this mechanism , or something that is unconsciously familiar with you .
so making these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
because people are often coming , they can &apos;t use it to get everybody to deal with it .
here &apos;s the one again , we &apos;re going to see the diesel again , again , all the individual aggregate .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
people are actually shining up in their faith , so tightly that they can &apos;t free .
now , if i had opened the folder to the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physiotherapy was done .
evolution is all about the continuing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival of generation .
all right , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
they put the decision on -- they push up , even when it comes to their own best interest .
so in other words , the future has shrinked every year since i &apos;ve been in this world .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it go into the next century .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us have only threatened before one generation , hardly yet .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die of it , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then i elevate my strength and exhaustion .
a commilite from me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a little too shrimp .
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
we find men in the marching riots of the citizenship movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
but quickly , another example of feeling is not about people , but things we use and consume .
it could be , for example , a us-american power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it because things change .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and it at different levels .
i have young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a piece of advice i can do this . &quot;
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
the starting point is that people have only been on the planet for 23 years .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that make a mac computer together .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably caught some birds . &quot;
the big digital warhead -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
my mother was working on farms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , twice layers .
so , when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i &apos;m saying that because identity is power .
i know they were racity-arithmetic , i know they were sexist , but they were great .
so what we have here are the cover images of every single sports illustrated , &quot; which have ever been printed .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were in a way .
and then she ran to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles is writing .
the reason i hold my wrist is because that &apos;s the secret of illusion in it .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , it has to be really errors that digital information .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process that is very different from classical engineering .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with you to finish your epic mission .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seen , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that . now , you do it , you do everything else we do .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think that way , i started working on a contract .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think back to the time of your childhood when you played with timbers .
that means all life counts is not to save , not to avoid , to reduce .
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problems .
and this project , i &apos;ve been bringing back to the kind of archaic , cognitive models .
it &apos;s wonderful , even though i &apos;m standing on the stage with a duo partner , and we have the same wavelength .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back into the notes , even though i mean to memorize them .
that to make music on the instrument that should do your musical doing and feel present before .
then this unpleasant feeling disappears , it might not even look like you , and it will always make you more similar .
because the music allows him to reform his thoughts and insanctions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
it turns out that miguel has spent the largest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article , and i kept on driving .
and he did , and when he set out a herself in the lower sector , he called the operators .
but today we are in a situation where we take people out important organs and we want to plant them other people .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should be right to marry their understanding of sex or marry .
so that , as people , when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time , somehow dangerous .
that &apos;s the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
and he pointed to the buses of tourists who came every day and used to have their cameras on them .
so here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects that we can all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
and we trust , we trust , blind of any government in the future , a government we might have in 50 years ?
now , we &apos;re trying to ask , can we regenerate life , or can we create new life , from this digital universe ?
when i heard that , i thought it was uncanny -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is running . it &apos;s a formula .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect disease course for a patient with breast pain .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
they built this complicated sequence of channels , and they urged water from the country and out into the river .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , one where food actually tastes well .
heinrich can march a woman in every state , but maria can now maria march a woman in a few states .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense to me , and that we should , i think , keep .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
what about the people who are not able to do this because they have no access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
there was a meeting for reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of your way . &quot;
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this -- a uniform formation in two dimensions .
so all the western kingdoms are expanded until they &apos;ve no longer done infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imployed .
and one interesting thing about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
meanwhile , the bell labs were announced the next revolution in bell labs , the next building block .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe also the ted communities need to get involved in it .
