and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now .
i guess what kind of genre , style i am would be like dark glamor .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
then they &apos;ll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their armpit .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
and so the film explores this whole idea -- it &apos;s what ? in perpetuity , forever ?
yes , you &apos;ll sense it if you &apos;re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went delved into it more .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besides your existence as a designer .
no , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off-the-record conversation . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
or , are we destined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-centigrade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
but these stories bothered me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength , and plus-one intelligence .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
and , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
when i turn up in my little vw clunker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker . a little story .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doomed .
and yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
you have to be able to cater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
that i can suddenly that the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
and that &apos;s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is usability of course .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
through my work i &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are tingling . &quot;
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
i &apos;m talking about the soul .
we know that something else is really true .
that sounds very spacey and like science fiction , i know .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire brigade .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re deceiving yourself .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
we &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,100 ?
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , i must say .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
i &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
the human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here , and all the individual aggregates here .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i incorporated it into a design workshop .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little strident .
dk : you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
we find men on the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
i have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer , how they came together .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
i know they were racists , i know they were sexist , but they were great .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced .
i had very low -- i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what charles has written is not true .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
that means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
so , i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment .
i brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these archaic , cognitive models are being addressed again .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wavelength .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance .
then that unpleasant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
it turns out , miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
i don &apos;t want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s uncanny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
if we had twenty percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
henry can marry in every state a woman , but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
that &apos;s why all western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the australian aboriginals .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attractive .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon you will .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
that humans are supposed to have descended from apes and that , yes , there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no billboards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fliers , nothing .
we want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
but , ancient greece and ancient rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o.k. ?
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
and that scientifically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is kissed away .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
visitors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet .
once you &apos;ve seen that that that you can see a dalmatian in this , you know it .
i was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already retired before i finally started studying .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza , spain .
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you .
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i was just asked whether this sack is a talking sack and will talk for me .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
i &apos;ll have to provide some background information here , biohacking deals with modern molecular biology .
can i handle it directly or do i need a manual or a correspondent training .
if i had really been a egotist , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
and with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the onions .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble .
now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they &apos;ve thought of .
our organism has come up with an excellent method to make unpleasant feelings like envy simply disappear .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
because you project an assumption that you &apos;re seeing something you recognise to the front , such as a circle .
that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david mckay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
the monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna , but they did have a concept of birthright .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
i first went to antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify .
now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents .
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it march 3rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
i find the last two words under &quot; near antonyms , &quot; particularly unsettling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wholesome . &quot;
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
we have this banner in our offices in palo alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
and what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ?
henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on march 1 , 1980 .
now for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in intersex , i &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
in your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many doors there are .
and it was expressly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to rediscover the real world .
several years ago here at ted , peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutrients .
that &apos;s why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right .
the artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
my response to him was , &quot; well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? &quot;
and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across america .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wires . &quot;
and i regretted the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse .
we don &apos;t only have such amazing lies in art and folktales , but also in science .
he then made this this this helmet , and it took place in in cooperation with the museum .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
it &apos;s exciting , because things happen that we didn &apos;t practice and we aren &apos;t able to practice .
an amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choosing one thing , you &apos;re choosing not to do other things .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
we will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll-on or stick , whatever it may be .
and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying an x chromosome , meeting the x chromosome of the egg .
but to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
we need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn &apos;t be able to go on living .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
impoverished imagination , a myopic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums .
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
so if i invite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn &apos;t help you at all .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
yet , when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
we piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
we &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
i think bach would have been very enthusiastic if he &apos;d had the tonal possibilities that today &apos;s modern pianos have .
i said , &quot; miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
i realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
see , when you do a google image search for transparency , this is --- this is one of the first images that comes up .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
a child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own .
today , i play this piece every few years and it &apos;s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed .
so anybody who &apos;s ever had a soup gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
we can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four gearshifts , to 56 car colors , high choice .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
i will clarify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtuality .
we actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical s-curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and i don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .
vinod khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat .
so the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places .
it &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . it is power , the crude face of domination .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
and the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have plus-one speaking , and plus-one crazy idea , plus-20 crazy idea .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
norman mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
i gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
we took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice .
but then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
now , you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
he &apos;s only interested in keeping himself free of the necessity to prove that there are predictors .
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
you offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
we have an abstract an abstracted language .
we &apos;ve got used to things happening in a linear fashion .
you imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predictors .
so even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and perceptual psychology .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
and here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i packed for this exciting week here at ted .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
so we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
i must honestly say , and you witnessed this , i found it hard to talk about my idea at first .
it exists on a small scale , so you can use your shaving machine in the car via a small power inverter .
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university .
sure there are some of you who will say , yes , but what do you do if if you can &apos;t sing ?
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move permanently someplace else right now .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; excuse me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
and that &apos;s not within the range of amateurs , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
i mean think of it , when antonio damasio asks about your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox today . &quot;
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
or , will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or &quot; american idol . &quot;
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four gearshifts .
because i don &apos;t think anyone will say , i don &apos;t know whether i like the taste , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
that means that if you &apos;re at seventy percent renewable energies , then you won &apos;t be able to do that without a reservoir .
and just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated .
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
but if you want to hook up several of these power inverters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated .
the diesel will be the back-up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part .
the world &apos;s hunger for energy that we are seeing is relieved with diesel fuel , because you don &apos;t need a license for it .
and the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accordingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
