sounds familiar , what ?
we can do that .
i &apos;m interested in that .
lento , slowly .
yeah , good day .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going on .
this is the system .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
the farm is incredible .
may i be honest ?
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s great important .
it &apos;s a crisis .
what do you say ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so that one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
it has sensors .
here &apos;s the video .
they &apos;re all important .
hide them .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
completely inefficient .
wonderful , ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
that &apos;s me .
incredibly exciting .
very different term .
okay . thank you .
it &apos;s essential .
so they &apos;re al .
and she did .
thank you very much .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good work ! yes !
yeah , good day .
they have similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
yes , milliseconds .
all the environmental debate .
how interested you are .
that &apos;s a wish .
bg : thank you .
not very often happens .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
how do we know that ?
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
you can go in there .
i have a question .
that would have been okay .
so they knew everything .
so how does this work ?
they use their hands .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i thought about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
what do these people need ?
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
so let &apos;s see .
they trigger . &quot;
so they do that .
players aren &apos;t sitting around .
i was facing him .
let &apos;s call it don .
you could see manhattan .
it &apos;s generic .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
but you know what ?
what happened here ?
centers were built .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
reevaluate it .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
these people make money .
what happened here ?
and i was an artist .
not guilt management .
and it has to go back .
we can do it differently .
what is media today ?
flying cat .
this is the last one .
can we change it ?
these days are over .
yeah , it &apos;s done .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to pick up .
home , where ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a whole lot .
does that sound good ?
the sun goes up .
fantastic , right ?
long , yeah .
the only chance .
yes , so to speak .
thank you . thank you .
that was incredible .
three out of 10 .
stephen watts .
thank you .
no hospital either .
it &apos;s terrible .
you need time .
that &apos;s us .
a few .
and he says ...
we know that .
da-da !
stop twice .
here it is .
that &apos;s fast .
i don &apos;t know .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
after a week .
from seattle ...
that &apos;s singing .
but it &apos;s done .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
this is not ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
60,000 .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
positive .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
ol√© !
maybe not .
thank you .
unique .
thank you .
fine .
suck .
sustainable .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
just about it .
one ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s true .
is that going on ?
well , yeah .
this is what you &apos;re doing .
seriously .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
really .
yeah .
okay .
thank you .
yeah !
creativity .
yes ?
yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
here we go .
yeah .
yeah .
yes ?
thank you .
why ?
fantastic .
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
about that .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
hello !
wow !
again , here you have it again .
what is this thing ?
this was about christmas .
so why now hacking ?
so it &apos;s the n circle .
does it make you curious ?
because you can train this .
and what did that feel like ?
my wife told me .
this is a natural thing .
it &apos;s kind of like , you know .
thank you for your attention .
i loved only two .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
they want to feed the world ?
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
the same thing , just the same thing .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and finally , epic meaning .
but the key thing is , ...
very scary .
remote technology .
they called me .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
what happened there ?
and then they set up .
and he works like this .
so that &apos;s the good news .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
how about fitness ?
these changes are in the coming .
one place is south korea .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
the answer is yes .
you could have done better .
it was just not invented yet .
and it &apos;s the crux .
the answer is no .
so let me remind you .
is that reasonable ?
that &apos;s god , you know ?
this is a game out .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
pattern recognition should work .
well , i was the next one .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
they always say , why ?
there &apos;s no problem at all .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
so they saw something magical .
it was a huge success .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
but they do the job .
sometimes i push too much .
first extension , second extension .
they saw the big impact .
and then everybody went down .
i was terrified .
that was the beginning of the journey .
but it was very sad .
and that worked very well .
this is very risky .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plussignature .
this is a picture of this place .
think about your own decisions .
okay , there are a couple .
her mother would stop her alone .
they connected these two people .
tell me about this world .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
why not think about it that way ?
you see that at the bottom .
you also have to understand that .
most of you know this .
we need to spread the message .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
it sounds crazy , right ?
will it be my size ?
his name is tempt .
what do i look at ?
i find that fascinating .
i find that fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the short term .
you see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
i want to ask you something .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
i can say everything .
what is the soul ?
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll end now .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it sounds sober .
we were 20 people .
we &apos;re too many with that .
you can &apos;t have bones .
it &apos;s kind of like that .
or is it possible ?
conflict comes from creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
actually , i made two mistakes .
he went up and down .
we love technology and creativity .
it would be unknowless .
we &apos;re always bumping up .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
i mean the soul .
i created one .
first , narrow .
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
what creates the illusion ?
and so did it .
very expensive real estate .
and i always had .
does anybody see anything in particular ?
give pee a chance .
but that &apos;s not protection .
luckily not , yes ?
in china , it was different .
you do comparison .
yeah . all right . all right .
what would everything have to be done ?
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and why is that ?
i agree with you all the time .
yeah , here it is .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
dk : 60,000 .
i think more than that .
some people have come and gone .
ooh , thank you .
am i going to like the color ?
it &apos;s against justice .
thank you .
they even hurt .
why should we do that ?
thank you for listening .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i wonder .
i swear it .
it feels great .
i propose children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
the game is 2007 .
there &apos;s no food .
an incredible challenge .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but it didn &apos;t .
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
thank you very much .
here you see it .
but it gets worse .
jk : both .
put out the camera .
... invent his own story .
it would be intolerable .
crisis . death . disaster .
and many people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he always pointed out here .
it was still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are criminals online .
privacy must be given .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be discouraged .
here you see the city .
how do we actually work people ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
but where are we useful ?
the work of interpreting .
that &apos;s pretentious .
let &apos;s call it don too .
but what do your fish eat ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
first , we have the population .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
now , what do you think happened ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
it &apos;s not our problem .
good day , everybody together .
he loved it very much .
she did secretly .
and it got better .
it &apos;s an almost identical structure .
is that your opinion too ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is amit .
just keep going . lots of fun .
the answer to that is no .
okay , a few more .
there was remixes .
let me summarize it .
it &apos;s not our fight .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
i &apos;ll never forget .
it has billions of those .
did you see these guys ?
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
is it even photography ?
he &apos;s my grandfather .
ooh .
and then it became international .
so she was back .
and i kept working .
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
what do you want to do ?
let me tell you .
oh . a moment .
why does this happen at all ?
we need energy miracles .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going in here .
or bombs .
but i kept working .
not toxic in it .
you see it immediately .
here &apos;s an example .
this is a child game , right ?
this is like talking learning .
have you ever been tired of that ?
i shoot something through my head .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and then we said , okay .
so i just started playing .
and so the dynamic really changed .
so , look what happens .
so the correlation is low .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
what about longevity ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
the game starts -- silence .
and this video is real time .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
because to me , it means memory .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
all adults were aware of the risks .
it spreads rapidly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
it &apos;s not being documented .
they sell certificates .
and there are several reasons for this .
we started it 15 years ago .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
i find them disgusting .
just be who you are .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
next , nuclear energy .
that sounds scary .
that &apos;s frightening .
hmm , my brand ?
let &apos;s leave that quietly .
this is completely trivial .
nullemissions , yes ?
but we need to get that overall .
but it &apos;s effective , right ?
the motivations of writing it .
now i tried something more exciting .
dark urine . dark .
what is a story about ?
i remember my first fire .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
what else is risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you very much for your patience .
her family gathered together .
and his answer was yes .
this is how you can do something like this .
do you want to protect jeans with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
and that &apos;s really the beginning .
anyway , not to navigate .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we say sustainability in germany .
how and what did he feel ?
but maybe this is not the case .
but the truth is far from it .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like beautiful clothes .
you see something fun here .
apparently it was quite popular .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measured its movement .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
something got a bit stiff inside of me .
oh , my time is already over ?
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they are an inspiring personality .
the book and the picture .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is full of great statistics .
i don &apos;t take the same process .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
they were genetically expressed .
privacy is not the debate .
lego made it possible for all of you .
our magazines are read by millions .
a has these benefits and risks .
these rivers are rapidly taking over .
this is the memory basins .
here he &apos;s leaving the sun open .
it was a pretty fate project .
i &apos;d like to show you that .
do we really want to go this way ?
this picture reminded me of something .
does anybody know what three seconds is ?
we can get our nutrients back .
this is the minimum of the moment .
you can show , i was there .
if you get up , right ?
that &apos;s what the age difference has to be .
and still , it &apos;s not an interpretation .
so the first step to an interpretation .
you know what is tired ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
how far do you get to this ?
music is medicine . music is changing us .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
i stop this , thank you very much .
you can do it all the time .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re going to be irresistible .
but what will come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
it has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason .
anyway , we need a solution .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
they flew the channels .
i was absolutely trying to work normally at that time .
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
once the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t do it simply .
so i went to the court .
i was scared of technology .
doesn &apos;t taste very well either .
she shares her experiences with others .
my name is brian goldman .
he actually collected fish .
it was my first sunburn .
people were still happy .
let them be alive . &quot;
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
we &apos;re dependent on two countries .
and we &apos;re going to pick it up .
so , not like detox .
if we have the waste , right now .
an autistic student .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
and here &apos;s the picture .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
she was back and forth in the dying .
i almost never cook with it .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
what should our testimony look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
take nothing but granted .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
nobody said that ever before .
the data is always showing .
they have so much uncertainty .
they create an epic story .
which would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and he again showed him jafour .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can do that .
how many people would choose creativity ?
is this all ineducation ?
now , how could that happen ?
play is not silly .
the data was not available before .
you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the power plant can explode .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from artists .
but i &apos;m not buying anything new .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
well , then we want to .
what happened that day ?
the story is not over yet .
no had never been an opportunity .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but it &apos;s not that fast .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
and that made me really sad .
it &apos;s not our burden .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i learned everything memorized .
that would have not been a problem at all .
this has the biggest impact .
there should be other things not suffer from that .
and then realizing it .
because does anybody here have masses ?
they become free to computers .
this is about five meters long .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
my second mistake was worse .
one time , we started a vibrant .
okay , it really does courage .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the shape plays a role .
what lessons have we learned ?
further than that , we don &apos;t go .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
slowly but surely , it laid down .
they get more and more similar .
because i can say everything .
this is all metadata .
we use the energy of the sun .
i &apos;m going to stand you something .
and it starts with a doctor .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t .
asked the nurse sachonically .
it &apos;s all easy to have today .
creativity had to somehow get out .
the white lines are for population .
in the morning , before the game .
italy wins . yeah .
the whole building was made of water .
they can play with different kinds of ways .
and then something funny happened .
what other brands are like this ?
so this is one of the images .
basically they do the same thing .
and then we did .
we &apos;ve gone to an area .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
that was grandios .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
but , but you know what ?
i started feeling better .
but there are two problems with this .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
so the question is : how ?
and we &apos;re too many .
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
it just doesn &apos;t technologically do that .
he pointed to the algae .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we can support them to be good .
but with the right design , please .
the mechanism is from lying .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
we also got very accurate data .
this is going to happen in april next .
he shake his head , no .
it was really incredibly profound .
we &apos;re talking about it in twenty ways .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i think is .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
i read to you the input .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
the main man winked me up .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
we can support them to be good .
and women did succeed .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
the roof was also covered with water .
this is a painting of a circle .
this is usually not the route .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
we talk about the kitchen , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
there was jimmy kimmy drum coming .
even cats look at this video .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
i believed everybody could .
that i had written these crazy things .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
he turns off the engine .
... so , not so optimistic .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
politely , everybody applauded .
now we saw the reverse effect .
he pulled back into silence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked late to night .
so scott gets this fruit .
maybe lead some mutations .
they kept us inspired by this .
i impersonated people in death cells .
it might take you to get it invited .
now look at this curve .
we go through initiation rituals .
you &apos;re the countries of someone &apos;s home .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re all engaging questions .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
we have to get far , fast .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
so from modern into computer society .
you see , you know , from the back to the front .
a dalmatiner , right ?
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
and that was the outbreak of it .
it &apos;s not even the truth that &apos;s going to free it .
we have masses in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
there &apos;s also a role in dosage .
everybody would like to make people happier .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and there are quite a lot of employees .
so the first exciting primate .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
conditions of this species don &apos;t exist with us .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
it &apos;s called &quot; springs with me . &quot;
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
does anybody know what that is ?
so , tempt is now fully paralyzed .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
tell me a little bit about that part .
you can be logical and intuitive .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
and i &apos;d like to read them to you .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
i lived in parallel worlds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let go . &quot;
the bank is from a different place .
this is a modest little app .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center in boston .
so there &apos;s a feedback plumbing .
it can know how we hold it .
i learned a few very simple things .
to say alone , what &apos;s information ?
something very strange is going on here .
you should also wish for them .
what are these three billion people going to bring to us ?
we expect an extraordinary couple of decades .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
but i kept asking myself about those questions .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
she was not drowned yet .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
156 nations send our television channel .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , no , missing far .
maybe again , have to look back at it .
odds are simply part of our lives .
i see the dalmatiner .
what does five million seconds take ?
the thing that &apos;s just been presented .
this is a commissioned part .
you put a boss there .
the chef had cook it .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is an environmental network .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
and also , these sources are interrupted .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it do ?
and even lomborg thinks about it .
there was never a time like this before .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve gone .
what do you think happens next ?
tell me what you feel .
they drilled through each other .
here you see how the building works .
completely set on a particular goal .
he died , broken through the story .
it will touch it deeply .
you lose rare animals always .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
this sounds basically unusual first .
so there are two circles .
especially when he died .
i hope you forgive me .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
they literally moved the lever around .
it &apos;s been consistent so far .
so this is a tough foot .
they have them . they always have them .
the byproduct is clean water .
it &apos;s about changing normal .
i started with my usual talk .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i learned this from my grandmother .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i jumped on it .
but it requires a lot of planning .
who would ever wish ?
the defeat would have been too simple .
her father died shortly after her birth .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
for one year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
the stones are colored .
it &apos;s longer than those other two networks .
often in the third hand , forget about it again .
and it depends on phosphorus .
it &apos;s how we think of north .
we can reinvent everything .
i started an institute for this .
so the natural things are presented .
automatically , he &apos;s walking to the right thought .
they &apos;re now called projectors .
it &apos;s about intrinsically .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to happen .
he was already over six years .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
it makes leukemia in children .
and this sounds very different from the beginning .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
i loved that fish .
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
a billion people are going to starve today .
now i see greg lemoon .
we have something that doesn &apos;t increase .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeve back .
and the goal here is quite simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story could be true .
who don &apos;t want to be healthier children ?
we won a few prizes .
and i had to go out of town .
okay , you really want to know that ?
that was more emphasizing .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
but then they really want to get deep .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
here &apos;s her brand alert .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
happy productivity . fantastic !
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
thank you , but the best one &apos;s coming .
they gave their blood pressure elevators .
the living bears are the spirits .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
people about urine .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
there are also world record .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
what words would you describe ban ?
they &apos;re very good at doing this .
that &apos;s over 250 thousand acres in the morning .
the result was catastrophic .
and nobody seems to get above that .
all these generations need just a few milliseconds .
i tried to understand them .
for energy , this is what happened to me .
and you &apos;re feeling it already .
these things are logically accurate .
the students are divided to grades .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
this is what &apos;s interested in fire .
and he &apos;s signed up there .
here they have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate .
these are the apsaras .
this is ideology , not science .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
i call this the luminous tiger .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
we need to think about which brands .
the movie hasn &apos;t been delivered yet .
they even bring in funding .
here &apos;s the olive oil going .
who do you really want to inform ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could have done all this ?
i talked a lot about magic .
and that got me so confused ...
my brother stared at me .
this is perhaps being broadcast public .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of procedures .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
risk is not a simple game .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
bjnorn sundin .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
i tried to preserve the body .
and the two last ones are also here today .
now you see the dalmatiner .
this is what &apos;s called the osit-model .
shattering the environment , consumes less energy .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s pointed out to it , right ?
you can dive in a certain year .
you can jump directly to a particular issue .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning &quot; information . &quot;
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
and there &apos;s the battling problem .
my parents are the 80 on the heels .
we &apos;ve forced them . we phew them .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we reject genetic meets that were technically altered .
what ? it really freaked me out .
now , if you think a little bit further .
i wanted to restore health for a disease .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
they are in the back of our bodies .
donnerday : self-confidence is the key .
summer was happy summer -- 2006 .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
it was something we knew how to do .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
it sums up thousands of square kilometers .
third technology : categorization .
my fourth technique : requirement for complexity .
my grandmother never left me alone .
but so many of them received help over the years .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
you can go in very easily and zoom out .
so , that really blew me out .
when you burn natural gas , no .
you know , science is not a company .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
people suffered . people fought .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can think of vibrant skills as change .
raise your hands . let me see me .
so imagine that just for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
second half-time . end of normal play time .
that &apos;s something built in the city .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
you go around and you amuse yourself .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
we &apos;re thinking about energy today .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
the official dogma of what ?
three : escalation of expectations .
your problem is you have too little .
they laughed more than you do here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the machine below gene .
if not , somebody else today is squawking .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
now i &apos;m adding a barrel .
so that made sense , it fit together .
we need to use more research funding .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
my grandparents were pushing this number to 70 .
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what hasn &apos;t worked .
shame . shame .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
let me show you from the very close .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population in the entire population .
so just go ahead ; save the shoes .
intersexuality is in many different forms .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
so again , this was really good enough to fit together .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and this is a million-company .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think i may have heard more hands .
motors , motors , gear -- four possibilities .
nobody has to give green ideas .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is it about the details or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well planned .
scott was talking about human beings to human beings .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
yet , we seem to be quite pleased with this .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and let me show you a simple example .
i work in the solar technology industry .
we &apos;re in the middle of that transition .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
well , i went to the court hall .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
the three words were : remember ?
we still think they &apos;re original .
i thought i could integrate .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
here &apos;s a couple of them on the hampton .
well , this cartoon is what some people say .
seriously , the entrance has been refused .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
and if not , still dance .
the duration of the duration is labeled with red .
anyway , they do it .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
this is compared to china in a second .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
all of it is composable of it .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go another slide .
our goal was to say , okay .
and in time , they can react to something else .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
but i didn &apos;t let myself get away from that .
this one has to go all the way down to zero .
say , there are no prediction .
so the instruments have evolved now .
or take a lip pen .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
i &apos;m the museum guy .
they make us worse for that .
the amount of water has been expanding .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
imagine mozart efficient .
so , help me a little bit .
do you remember the needle ?
and then , usually it looks like this .
it kind of sucked us up .
if you burn coal , no .
monday : color is a bit more powerful .
we &apos;ve been asking , and nobody knew .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
can you also play them in blue as well ?
no , we &apos;re going to determine what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s a central point in there .
now , everybody &apos;s eaten cake .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
and the list is readily removed .
so , that was my primary motivation .
restore america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology itself .
it &apos;s the average achievement of the bat .
what are the archaic models now ?
here are two different jewelry facilities .
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i have it here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to act directly with the artist .
it &apos;s a whole cool whip .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you see the timeline up there .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
and we get an absolutely flat line about that .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
my cousins walked around all over the place .
many of my clients are very young .
i think our identity is threatened .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
alone , humiliated and not supportive .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it was a grouper .
a language is expression of the human mind .
let &apos;s get something else out of it now .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything but discover .
his personal impressions of the sea erodes .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
maybe i did it with good reason .
they grow out to be five inches .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
so littlebits is open source .
now this level of intuition is very important .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
this is an annual digestive flow .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
he &apos;s got to process that as a present .
i &apos;m trying to do this in an example .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
and then he can walk away .
because now they can use a three-sentence .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
bad ? i was completely confused .
and what do you do with the waste ?
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that much .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
you can predict that . why is that ?
thank you very much , that was incredible .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
this is just the title of labor , by the way .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
the difference is then perceived as loss .
and on , now you see him .
no tree is carbon neutral .
so basically , a translation of the translation .
so what can we make out of all of this ?
isn &apos;t enough for half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
what do i call for ?
so , it &apos;s here . right there .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
there are a lot of great books on this topic .
no insurance can be rubbed .
the emergency staff was moving all the strands .
it &apos;s built in two hours everywhere .
i want to explain that a little bit .
three sentence is still what you know from school .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
actually , bear didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
it all comes from our own bags .
shake the environment , make less waste .
it should be the two elements again .
this is just a insurance method .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of glorious music .
thank you . i have a question for you .
but the game is a shape-changer .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and anyway , italy won the end of it .
here you see roberto dance .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to relate to this .
ordinary people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
but i &apos;ll get to talk about that in a minute .
the next step has now happened within these communities .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i get tired of us all .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
but western governments also help themselves .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
this is one , a part of her .
and it was ecologically a catastrophe .
that really solves the fuel problem .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
no apple ever tasted that way again .
i was not familiar with the labels .
but what happens to citizens connect is different .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
the premise of dna was an interesting step .
the silence is earnings .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
and to give feedback to my superphysician .
one was , i thought he had kidney rocks .
the corporate headquarters are right here .
there are some that are much more spatial .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
here are some more people who test it .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
and we see it &apos;s going to work out .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
it &apos;s not all to be composable , of course .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can still revote them .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
i think first of all , curiosity is .
that &apos;s what u.s. is doing for hundreds of years .
now , they understood the advantage of prototyping .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
there seems to be an unagreement .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
store it off , erase the rest .
everybody in manhattan is gone .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern of development .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news , apparently .
and in that mind , the memory was played .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
and what &apos;s the point ?
in the countries where people come to money .
so , we can &apos;t make these things at all .
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of water .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
how about living longer in good health ?
i have something i want to show you here .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
all around the world , these dizzles are around to be almost almost .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
so this was a very strange experience .
did you all take your vitamins this morning ?
there were no cantaloupei melons .
as i said , amanda is wearing our elegs .
both of them are survival , both sin .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
or they didn &apos;t have photooligraphy .
and the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
it &apos;s kind of a beneficial poop print .
and in my youth , i said , &quot; expectation . &quot;
because the notes are the only connection to him .
there &apos;s no such thing as interpretation that i &apos;ve been talking about in early education .
designing a phrase with its own breath .
why do i have to afford a little car like that ?
he &apos;s just fooling her and not self-conceiving .
because without these lies , we can &apos;t live .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence at all .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
so , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
for nathaniel , music means mental health .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
i can do the sequence as it runs off .
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure success .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
marshmallow has to be on top .
well , i understand . i do .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
many of you probably know this trick here in the room .
... that the doses also play a role .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
this is not how happy a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
and that &apos;s not just gender .
but how do you do that in practice ?
here are the results we just got .
so they can do the whole movement .
this is something like our campscream .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
the answer will probably be &quot; no . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother i wouldn &apos;t do that .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i put my job at 95 kg .
this is a dead turtle .
so every trickage was a little bit different .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
and out of me , a character in the book becomes a character .
i remember it was yesterday .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
all of this is comprehensible .
so you don &apos;t often lose any animal preceding .
they get less less than that because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but not always that bad thing is , either .
this is a two-second time record .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
if your job is dancing , dance .
and you also feel your movement and your tendency .
now , he &apos;s going to take a tractor to the scene .
anyway . i certainly want .
technical cycles are the same .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
the first is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
these things have a more positive effect .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
on the left you see a little boat .
so i think we need to be leaders .
so we have this horribly simplistic idea .
so two couples , each baby is witnessing .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationship .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re morocalizing .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
it has a button , on / out .
and this is the market coming next week .
today , a lot of people have given up on government .
and try it again with another generation .
storytelling is always using more senses .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
and then i wonder : how could this happen ?
and we &apos;re constantly increasing our expectations .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and i went back to work .
the question is , why do people accept it ?
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
then he whispered me to the ear .
there &apos;s every footprint disadvantaged .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
what would you tell someone who believes it ?
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
and this is very important in medical research .
there can be a order of changes .
this is alfred gonzalez .
what do you do with certificates ?
so you can &apos;t put them together wrong .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
we &apos;ve only signed up at first .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
and they had to take away what we did .
now , they &apos;re all back on their way .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about that .
that the issue of ecology is a global issue .
usually i &apos;d take out the needle now .
picasso answers , just wait .
nobody else has done that in the world .
natural light then offers smart grid .
what &apos;s the food processing ? &quot;
every morning , they fly 160 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly back 240 miles .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government now .
i was totally , you know , really , really , really , really .
they live with chemosynthesis help .
this is going to be a key element to this toolbox .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pretend that we have a machine here .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
and in my work , i learned very simple things .
so every concert is a different concert .
so smart grid , a huge topic everywhere .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
the last three out of five have been summarized .
this is a problem that many players have .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and we need to do a lot of work better .
and now what i &apos;m saying is very important .
actually no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so , the theme of the day : saving financial .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
there are some very interesting developments .
we want to do something about death penalty .
so don &apos;t save , discount , avoid .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge that &apos;s going to offer for nine .
the land would roll on them .
is i really sorry . is that crazy ?
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
all of those were like this , started to divide .
he came to me and hugged me .
now everybody in this pattern is trying to see something .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you briefly .
it was a lot of going on , and i was in a hurry .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent them .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the people .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
at the beginning , tribal society is through language .
i &apos;ve highlighted it very much here .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they don &apos;t spend time in power fights .
what happened was that we could do that .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and of course , it did a click .
i want to show you something too first here .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers go along .
so i spoke to a conference a few months later .
i never want to change anything more in life .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
i start with some simple examples .
the best part is -- one second .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
that our contribution to the system is the election .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
notice two things about this curve .
do you know what you call a 400th ?
i hired her and made her treatment .
it supports others when they talk about their mistakes .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and everything is packaging or content .
so we &apos;re starting with a windows dropper .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
&quot; look at your tubes , pink .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
and i took a while to figure this out .
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
this is another view of the tree of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
they moved to a natural concept .
so imagine a sound sound plane .
he says , &quot; prepare for the impact . &quot;
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
and if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not anything that happens .
think about it . this attack is generic .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
you can look around all these museums here .
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
look , let me give you an analogy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
loans and sponsors were searched .
and we designed an ipad app .
so he got the citizens to check them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so these women met and just talked .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
child mortality has declined by a tenth of a coverage .
so you could probably feel like selling it .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any point about what &apos;s true .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so please listen to the day a music is played .
and that &apos;s the message , you know , that &apos;s the message .
how many would choose to think good ?
so imagine two other small changes .
this is an idea worth spreading .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , go ahead and start inventing .
go and squawry leonard cohen .
his whole process of working has changed after that .
and we can look at that now .
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s hard to overrated the destruction .
and so my way of making films changed completely .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here are some natural fireflies .
because they have special skills of processing .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
there are some places we can turn to .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
it &apos;s worrying and strange programs .
i said , &quot; promised , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with all of you .
and then that &apos;s there , and that &apos;s what comes back .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
so in other words , i define what i want first .
the only problem with it was that she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the grandfather of this old man refused to be .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put in watermarks .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
and these interactive portraits are perceiving each other .
every society is shaped by a primarily medium .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
but these are all roads in the u.s. .
how can i make something that would be used friendly ?
and less usable or usable is it .
it &apos;s a refourth shape , right ?
i &apos;m never going to play as much as i &apos;m going to play in that moment .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and at all , you work much less than me .
because artists have a striped relationship with lying .
we returned to the titanic wreck .
and also , the energy cycle is very important for you .
where is the biggest interest in doing this really ?
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
we &apos;re going to run into the arms of placebo industry .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
or are they more like a downtown attribute ?
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
we converted them new , repaired them .
everybody knew your genius was a little laugh .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
it grows in the winter and shrinks in summer .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website here .
so , a climate change will get terrible for you .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
and here are two patients . these are their records .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be .
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to be facing .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
they can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
play is the tickle that holds us together .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
they teach them to open up doors themselves .
antonym : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
now , that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but it should be .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
we can continue these things on different examples .
what we &apos;ve stayed with is the story story .
it &apos;s nail , and it &apos;s just nail .
i don &apos;t know who knows about you is this picture .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
so my two passions kind of flourished .
and so i then made a slightly unusual decision .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
i thought we &apos;d just bring the poker review .
but you know what you &apos;re not right to ?
but one of them is much worse than the other .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in total .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
but are we going to make the best out of our play drive ?
we see the same thing in the disabled legal movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
from bird age to machine age .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency &quot;
here we were , and this is the painting .
all right , let me show you a little bit more of that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
this is the call center for service and information .
now we &apos;re doing this with drills and machines .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
we want to create mass imperative . &quot;
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the stuxnet .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
or are you more like a down-attribute ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
and that was an experience of humility to me .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
she hardly breathed , and she had moved blue .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
and that worked . it worked for scott .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and we use this word with this contemplation .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
she had the last word in every family .
wealth , not debt , it affects the outcome .
all right , really good , maybe a all-star .
i was a obsessive student .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard diagnosis to do .
so when you generalize it , this is what happens .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
yeah , what are we doing for projects like this ?
they virtualize reality without computers .
and fortunately , there are a lot of studies now .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
and we often reinvent ourselves as we want .
then i say , heartfelt pity , right ?
have a nice example of this .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you anything about reality .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
it &apos;s right , morality , patental stuff .
and the same thing was , after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bordpersonal anymore .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
my mother suffered from the boat in alpine .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
there &apos;s a program some of you may know .
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this player is about to be in front of an epic victory .
these results have been achieved by a couple of weeks of hard work .
another favorite picture of me , starry night .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
it also shows up in other places of the book .
and i just went over and i just listened to it .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the assisted doctor .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
same thing , i think , is that we &apos;re going to use games today .
... so , please , just show the slide .
you can say things here that are influenced worldwide .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much like . &quot;
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and we learn the rules of the game , and we learn the rules of the game .
i &apos;ll just agree , that &apos;s logical .
this is the kind of teacher shame .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and so it &apos;s not seen as a loss .
if you want to make them hyperlinks between the images .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
i &apos;ve got maybe another 40 years of work inside of me .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language teachers .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
but you won &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
so we &apos;re going to go ahead , and where are we going ?
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
people in the side rooms are now coming in .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
the dog ! i was linguistic of envy .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
it was &quot; eternity , forever . &quot;
a little bit more about you , not you .
and how was that for you ? what is it successful ?
we &apos;re now far from this goal .
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
today , i &apos;m going to report on unexpected discoveries .
al is a hydrant in boston city .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
i think it seems important to merge both .
but actually , that night , it was a bigger fun .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
supply america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
have you ever seen a climate-neutral tree ?
because , you know , it &apos;s a fun process .
i wasn &apos;t there for a long time with miguel .
this was not a movie , no hd , this was real .
in fact , progress society is based on energy advances .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re at this museum .
because the images were liking it for them to feel real .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
marsupial rat ? yes . alive ? yap .
we see the process that feeds itself .
it &apos;s not slowing down for any of our big problems .
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to desire ?
well , because you don &apos;t know it was once different .
diginotar is a certification place .
it &apos;s called the automatically compelling stone .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
she had suffered a non-treatable brain damage .
we have an abstract language .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambition .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course , how design really impacts your perception .
so how does a human being go about certain things accordingly .
that means you go back to criminal rates .
so , he &apos;s crashing , and he &apos;s like , like that ?
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photography .
it gives you attention to crowdsourcing .
it could be taken within a time learning framework .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnect .
they put them on the breathing machine .
it caused immense jubel in control room .
now , we have a political argument in our country .
this is what &apos;s happened to the nanny machine age .
as it used to be happening in the village , as it used to be .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
ask questions , ask for evidence , ask for evidence .
i know what people think when you see that .
ok , so imagine how extreme self-motivation is .
but we don &apos;t know a little bit about where things go .
there &apos;s more behind it , and it &apos;s even deeper .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
it was the misguided crossroads against drugs .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
and the fish was fortunate to be there .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but what if you want to see the brussels ?
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
and as you can see , these are not three special images .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
so , in a way , technology is going to blow us away .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had an impact .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
the breastfees still describe them as untouched .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that that &apos;s a big choice .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to ever change .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and we &apos;re still hanging very , very , very strong about stories .
this is the time you fall in love with .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound tank .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of companies .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
so i &apos;m going to step back and get the perspective .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
25 years from now , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
so i know about some who haven &apos;t been involved .
a baby needs about six thousand dizzling windmills .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
he lived in a nine-and-thirty years .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the tantians .
and then they &apos;ve done a whole lot of simulation .
and so he &apos;s flowing away his tormented conditions .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
it &apos;s this scary , coated taste .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
and there was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
well , energy has fallen over time .
this is a varied one thing that &apos;s been done .
diphony , rotels , kindergarten paralysis ...
you can just call it a few names , and people will understand .
they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tabak ?
in other words , game is our adaptation joker .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
i &apos;ve been filming in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
i would continue to do this work that i love .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and it &apos;s got ol√© ! it &apos;s not like anything .
this is an interactive animation of the trickfilming .
as i said , two thousand people thought it just started .
there &apos;s more likely to be my glasses .
because we &apos;re not going to make things free .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
i understood that that &apos;s the nature of art .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life in my life .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict you yourself .
bg : a breakthrough of energy is the most important .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
the biggest difference between them is the process of time .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
edward castronova is a economist .
so i say let &apos;s start the world-changing games !
is it available for others or is it affecting us ?
he steel every five hopes from my consciousness .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressiveness .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
france makes a tor . italy makes a gate .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
well , we introduced the mayor to the mayor hole .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
well , in this area , there are not thousands of targets .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction about it .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
and these were sort of the first of humans to develop toys .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
here &apos;s the up-to-date version of this one-to-one .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open doors to you ?
and no , it &apos;s not burning man or san francisco .

so gender can occur in many different varieties .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
zidane , in a moment the head hit .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
are you eight and mondaged like 007 ?
we should put the bear in the cage .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and alert .
i want to talk about the problem , and some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
it was looked at almost 50 million times this year .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so the occupythesectic movement has done it .
at one point , the screen fills with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he described one of them as very common .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
paralysis is a series of choices to many choices .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the remembering self .
in both cases , they did surgery , and they did well .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
many of you are covered by faces and so forth .
no , throw it away is exactly the right thing , right ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can flip that around .
i sell creators all over the country , around the world .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
now , how do people die in the aftermath of such hacks ?
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
that &apos;s why you think about how to weigh .
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
1m is the highest i &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my last .
so growth rate itself is accelerating .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
both of them nailed me , they asked me .
i can &apos;t play as much as i can do in 20 years today .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
so when it says , there &apos;s no soul .
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea .
many people speak of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
we were albering around there just like we were .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
when we start thinking about it , this is how it changes everything .
as a child , i used to draw comic books and things .
and in the course of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
this is starry night , probably never seen that way before .
our steps in digitizing life were exponentially .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . it &apos;s not an extension line .
urban designers and builders are very interested in this as well .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the checkout .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get it untrue .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital that &apos;s the physical .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really believe that something else comes after us .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
now it &apos;s in the red list of dangerous species .
we had no words for what we started there .
in the future , most crimes will be playing online .
the life itself has no voice in that choice .
you don &apos;t know anything that &apos;s possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to resolve in a moment what &apos;s inside .
a research semester on natural user interface design .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
this constant feedback is not true in life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
what else metamorphosis did you run through ?
so you can just go to google project.com .
we know another one where everybody is .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
it has eyebrows of life , one by one .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wanted to think i could see my children grow up .
it looks a bit like old-fashioned assemblers .
and what we realized was that i needed an expert .
now , where would you positioning your brain at this scale ?
cats look at cats looking at this video .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
the software coverage usually takes a few years to get it .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is happening .
we need to be in the government machine system .
the cost of solar energy has dropped by 50 percent last year .
i sent her home without talking to my superintendent .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good .
how many doors does the house you live in ?
and other ones are the ambitious , smart systems .
but also , our perception of ourselves , how disappointed it to us .
so you help with that , ask people what ?
i &apos;m explaining to you what these sounds might mean .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negotiating with the insultants .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
any of the more of a farm that your animals don &apos;t feed ?
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they did it by disposing the country .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so the device that you see there has not worked .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be in your own right .
the things that are only used are going into technical systems .
and as i turn around , the finger changes its position .
are you there ? you look a little nervous .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
so , if you could turn the light back on , please .
it &apos;s impossible to say , &quot; well , this photograph is actually put together . &quot;
we &apos;ve just passed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and i think it &apos;s a worried that the world looks like this .
second , what economists call opperituency costs .
i apologize that i have to cut so much down .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting in vision .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
there &apos;s a direct spinal system for this .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s losing half of his value in the first year .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collectively .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit curious .
and most of all , it &apos;s to ask what the right thing to do .
because the music is a language , and a language is for communications .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived it .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
you can pick up fish , but you also have a birdfish reserve .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a step-by-step manual there .
we &apos;re going to face a few more times in the next few days .
what it had ruined was the memories of experience .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
we think about our future as being predicted memories .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s happening inside .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s going to rape about 120 feet out of water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
that keeps us able , and we &apos;re moving forward and forward and forward .
the epiphany is , death is part of life .
the pilot ran the machine after the hudson river .
i &apos;ve not argued with my wife for two years anymore .
so the driving force behind it is cyber superpower .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
and what we found was that there was actually a context .
the words , as long as his friends , were spooking his .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
when we looked at how feelings varied with income .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
i would argue that we are ready for our own epic game .
again , what potential do we want to call out ?
which would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if it stopped moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
the example that i showed you was finding details .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i started thinking , well , i should just invent the project .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
i was shocked and tortured into the inner .
i went home through the emergency department on my way home .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves from themselves .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of our eyes .
i knew she had come to pass .
today , we &apos;re not just finding pleasure in something we &apos;re doing with it .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 products today .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
an amazing error rate . one in nine of them is innocent .
so here i want to present to you two , maybe three examples as well .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to witness a rolling iceberg .
this is someone who &apos;s surely met four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve been used to things being linear .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a mandant .
in it , they want to be in there , they want to get to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat it , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
the more money you make the happier you are .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to make it .
and the oil is going to replace it with other energy carriers .
and also , what you would think of today in the mind .
and then i get in immediately , and that &apos;s unfair .
so the more pink the gut the system . &quot;
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was kidding .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because they are the ones who are experts in flavor as well .
so better there should be a nine in my death row at the beginning .
these are many deaths from masses , 20 per hour .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
but it turns out that &apos;s not all that yet .
i hope you &apos;re very happy to do that . thank you very much .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
just that i think it likes him , right ?
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
and the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the film of statites .
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yes , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , this is someone who is completely logical .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting nature .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
that all of our survival is linked to each individual survival .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
i mean , how much will we honor our memories ?
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
imagine those images could really start flying .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingbroke .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
open up the map , and jump with a click .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing real estate .
ohhhhhh , wowww !
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call it a lot of money to the animal &apos;s catcher , it costs a lot of money .
what is this new state that the world is starting to take on ?
in fact , we are also such a multi-cellular community .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do injustice .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
we also brought littlebits to design schools .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . heartfelt wish .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be manly .
you know , there were no mandarines in paradise .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
today , i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
each of these topics , of course , was made up of many , many smaller decisions .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
a few months went on , and i just forgot everything .
so , depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and the result was that the phone had never been broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity for a long time .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry us .
so this is the same , bad team , one under the best .
how can we transmit these feelings from the games into reality ?
players are masters of social nets inside them .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people to happy .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
and of course , in germany , it can &apos;t be given it anymore . &quot;
this is what they &apos;re all in the pre-wind phase , as a matter of fact .
now , where should we go ? what &apos;s the right approach ?
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , although that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more force .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
it was completely closed , that it could fail .
then they wanted to kill them , because they were good food .
but if you &apos;re in an external country , you can see that .
somewhere here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is the audience that we just recently completed .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
we &apos;ve moved in the avian age that we call the bird age before .
i can say the canceller is a man .
he &apos;s got a 15 to one food processing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
a very concrete wish that we &apos;re inventing this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
well , your life of self is not going to get happier .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve been receiving all sorts of recognition .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive fallings .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it for this morning , &quot; he said .
and they were taking the lights through the rest of the book .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , when a bat hits 300 .
and all the time , i was collecting more knowledge .
i studied woman printers , and she was in breathing .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
now i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
we &apos;ve been in holland now in about three years .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
yeah , this is what it sees at the bottom there , you know , that load .
and immediately , i see another pattern that surrounds you .
so that really flipped me around , and i wanted more .
this goes back a lot more , into the pre-industrial cultures .
this airport alone has a 100 square kilometers area .
turned the trash ton to the side . went home .
the death penalty in america is defined by irritum .
it was always so inspiring , so fleeting .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of us .
56 percent of rape cases don &apos;t come to court .
well , in fact , the number of crimes has not changed very much .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
so , this looks like a basketball plate .
finally , a solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
this really only took about two thousand really eight shapes , these networks .
i think , kind of , six dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very promised hack .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
and six million seconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
it doesn &apos;t need to whistle or sing a song anymore .
and from that time , an anecdote you may know .
there was leopoldshafen &apos;s nuclear research facility .
i asked him how he became such a fish experts .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-neutral .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
now , the life itself lives continuously .
well , the two types of self are two terms of happiness .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
it means that we have reached a cultural impact besides the scientific impact .
six of the speakers : social decline . speakers 7 : 65 deaths .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
and they did it with what we call a leadland map .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
okay , let me squeeze some blood for you a little bit of blood .
imagine that every single one of people is being controlled .
and guess what we found in the code of attack ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict even ?
but instead of cranizing in panic , he just stopped .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had in the last half of the year .
but somehow , we can get away from this problem .
he invited the king of siam to the dinner dinner dinner .
this hit me when i wanted to share my jeans .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
so i &apos;ve been looking at when is natural or intuitive .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
i ate it first in a south spain restaurant .
what about paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate a strong government . we have no trust in the system .
we &apos;re putting in games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we degrade a human being worth doing our society .
we &apos;ve got his bed strapped so that he can see outside .
here &apos;s a piece of data from this code of attack .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you should do a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
why is it important to start new ? what is the red ?
an eight-eight , posted brand . how &apos;s your brand ?
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome the fear .
so a few years ago , i went to do exactly that .
opportunities that have not been allowed have been explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish had been taken on a smoke trip .
so there are programs that are the most common of the marriage can be .
in many areas , people were afraid of lynchmobs .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
how about a sentence of new , never heard before .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
54 percent of deaths have happened through drills .
the modern industrial world as we know it is almost 300 years old .
but besides that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
i gave an introduction to the lhc at the last ted conference .
and then we worked on a code-of-conduct like this .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
that means you navigate through sound and rhythm .
and then these are verbal influences of pre-industrial cultures .
the notes notes , in doing so , have the function of the letters of a script .
and i ask , how skillfully competent was this diagnosis ?
this is a fish elevated in the southwestern corner .
it &apos;s renewables , as they are called often .
the smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
i brought in seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange road .
so it turns out to be very difficult to look at all these extensions .
the biggest fear was they were scared of pirape and death .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much more riding road .
somebody had broken in , and they had hacked the system thoroughly .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re controlling all the minerals .
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they increase paralysis and they reduce happiness .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
there , in my opinion , was a very good code .
the interesting thing is , if i can take a little trip .
the composer becomes increasingly a friend you live with .
and i &apos;m not as sure they really stay here .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
this is actually the actual human and machine melting .
a couple . probably about as many as creative people are here .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of each on the planet .
i grew up with a wooden portion of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extensive , not intense .
so here finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and within a few years , lego went went into every household .
here i &apos;ll expand something . we look right here at the center .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to become more diver .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points of image , i think .
fireflies in a glass , i always found really exciting .
from my point of view , i looked up and down at the janitors .
the x-exact interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
and many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player certainly beats three out of 10 .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
so today evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds .
so now we &apos;ve restrained the timeline again .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
sometimes i lose balance . a story to the end .
i want to finish with a story that really got me excited .
because we &apos;re essentially restoring the past through marine protected areas .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
if we overdo it , we can shrink a little bit back .
when they walk , yes , every footprint destroys the floor .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
most people usually start orienting themselves in the task .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do it .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the inheritance itself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
this is an amazing adventure you &apos;re going to go to .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
think of this as a picture , as a flying spot .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one to talk to the airman .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
almost like we prepare for our lives for a long time .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just like that .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on their own .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is going very fast .
but you don &apos;t realize the previous losses .
they add a blue one to a green one , and they can make light .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i supposed to do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it would be like a thorny train out of air .
i look like i &apos;m writing a song like i &apos;m writing up ?
so if i put them aside , it makes them interest .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , for example , the environment , drives less car .
we all have to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
so the question is , how do we deal with these windmills ?
again , in each store , you can get things back .
and she asked him , what &apos;s your hobbies ?
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum is all , lots of ideas .
you can like to test it after my talk in your room .
it &apos;s a question of , can you get this to zero ?
has one person in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
most of you are completely ignored by the remembering self .
so you can ask : how happy is the life itself ?
if the museum has given us the picture , they click on it .
just to precise times , they agree with you .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
and i don &apos;t mean , necessarily , a technical definition of the platform .
i want to help you to make a very particular aspect of curiosity .
they now have a five-percent renewables in the order of 15 percent .
but while you &apos;ve been talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we produce androgen , and we talk about androgens .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty much a bite .
let &apos;s jump to moma quickly , again , in new york .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
who want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
and i thought , it &apos;s so hard , so painful .
this is technology support innovation that &apos;s out there today .
and the best part is perhaps what we &apos;re expecting in health .
but the question i want to throw is : why not ?
you feel that &apos;s the truth behind the arrival .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
now , he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
you &apos;re usually just standing wrong , and some people don &apos;t .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s supported .
they spend a lot of their time in the assembly of growing structures all the time .
the first of these drops is a resistant desire to admit complexity .
bonobos are all our nearest living relatives with chimpanzees .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
i don &apos;t know how people are going to be recipient .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
here &apos;s a evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
ceos is a little bit about average . but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
here he lifts up a rare glider .
innovation , creativity , development is not just coming from our heads .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
we think we can think of diginotar as the one .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation necessary .
this is an entire book , an example of non-imaging data .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
economists call this a pareto improvement .
we take pictures of this mini-big bang in detectors .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
and then the same thing as happens in a good , friendly conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what pille he should do today first .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , it &apos;s called miguel .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
and as a general term , we can use the word intersexuality for that .
i mean , what does anybody bring in with so many outfits ?
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
i really like your kind of sergey brin . well .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
they don &apos;t even come from museums , i think .
car color , outcolor of the car -- i have 56 options .
he said , &quot; there is no death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
the less i think about it , as it were , the more intuitive it is .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful at all .
when your work flew -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
all the parties , all the questions of society , supported this .
how good are you thinking are you in trying to make decisions ?
okay . everyone who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
we can better deal with more categories than we can deal with more choices .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
it brings pictures and text together , animation , sound and touch .
sometimes these ideas are going to rush ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
bryan , they really brought a string to swing .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
and this game was played by college professors and so on .
because there &apos;s something waking , which has kind of gone missing .
and this is one of the three main sources of the world that we have today &apos;s online problems .
beyond the simple play , littlebits is actually quite powerful .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice .
keep on there for your contribution , whatever it wants to be .
and the proposal was to build a lot more coal-fired factories .
i wrote down four words a day , and i &apos;d like to explain them briefly .
and to look at how we process information , how do we record information ?
the meaning of the letters is that when you can understand the language .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery , you can see .
i said , &quot; don , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish in our fish .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and we became a 4.5 year period of age to a real family .
and that &apos;s a thought i think is a reasonable approach .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are inconvenient .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
we know something about what the happiness of happiness itself determines .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
now why do i challenge my audience to listen to actively ?
and as i say the word justice , that unpleasant feeling is gone .
it &apos;s the last defense before something comes into the body .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
it &apos;s simultaneously a real-time 3d scan and motion shot .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
big data is being transformed for organizations around the world into big opportunities .
before i finish the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
you would agree with him freely to shine up when it snips .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room staring at me .
they &apos;re new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
if you do review and never do anything about it .
what you need is an environment that will put it in the position .
he finished the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m designing video games .
and that &apos;s then firing under the headquarters of open knowledge and citizen science .
the essential tool of information information information has been ever been stories .
and we can get it right now in this way that we can get nutrients back in agriculture .
to keep twins right with the composer .
you &apos;re basically learning how to read first before you just talk one word .
if i &apos;m not right , the chancer is not a man .
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
why ? because we don &apos;t have child paralysis , and you know what ?
a deception becomes something that &apos;s true because someone perceives it that way .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re about telling stories .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who suffered from both of them ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than it was for b in memory .
in our views , we were forward-looking areas of inconvenience .
it was won as italy as the football world cup .
they knew every bits and bytes that they had to attack .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to waste itself .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
we type , we rich in , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
he liberated us from one of the worst humankind minds .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as we are in play .
they are people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
if we look ahead , this kind of change will be increasingly possible .
but it wasn &apos;t until i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
tell me about why phase -- what is it that brings us ?
so quantum mechanics says unmoving objects feel the same .
he asked octavio to become his steady .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the chairman of our country ! &quot;
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; of youtube .
photographs where you have to think for a brief moment to figure out the trick .
and they developed great apps , working with urban staff .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
by 2020 , we &apos;re predicting two to five billion internet users .
&quot; do you remember the patient with the mature reef ? &quot;
you might think he was chasing fins , but that &apos;s not true .
and at the end , they just want to get the poorly overremnant .
this shows the enormous role that a marine reserve can play .
it shows you precise what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just experts .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then you tend to hire it .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .

the reason for that is , the government could track where a text came from .
listen consciously , and tell them whether they taste or not .

at the end of every day , i was cooking a giant top soup that we shared .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
that &apos;s because the government is like an ocean further , and politics are the top 15c .
and what we actually did , we , the human being , is we started abstracting .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
we want to fight pregenomes and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
and this was an example of how our own governments use technology against us , citizens .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps are the beating heart of our global climate system .
our cities have been scaled , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on , because with a normal , pristine electrochemical battery .
that means you need 15 pounds of wildfish to get a pound of ingredients of tuna .
one is the energy density that these technologies are creating dramatically lower than power plants .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , one called esolar has great solar technologies .
you put an exekutive administrator on the team , they &apos;re significantly better .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;ve moved to nostalgia , to wonder .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotted stuff like maniok .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
for bonobos and humans equal , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
so to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you a very basic , simple magic trick .
either &quot; oral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , they will have the choice .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
the next piece of the puzzle is how a boat in the early morning red is running quietly on lake .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , sticks , boxes and shells .
and one of the things that &apos;s really important about these archaic models is that we have a fundamentally natural relationship to virtuality .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
for her , life had challenged her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
already , in some flat lakes in alaska methane , in some of the water itself .
so , in the kind of shifting of evidence burden , you &apos;re experiencing the magnificity of lying .
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
you can &apos;t just point out enough , how critical this factor can be for the quality of life of a human being .
michael j. nelson of mystery science theater was a first person to twitter made a joke about it .
and also , despite their logarithmic process on the left , it &apos;s going to upward .
on the other day , they were going to lift her -- woman printer , woman , mother and grandmother .
both of them are strong underfueling because we don &apos;t look at the problem just as we should .
so i guess , lush aquaculture , fisheries , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
this sounds very spacic , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically seen by the european .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably most likely america &apos;s most yellow children &apos;s book author .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70-percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus benefits .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight we &apos;re all struggling to talk about who is going to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
you have to make the sound of the wind , and you have to blow away and read the rest of the book .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and power that it wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
because obviously , an animal that has been very common will rarely die out before it dies out .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this vibrant relationship between living and dead .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to how this slide is supposed to be .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
in china , a demand opf now is a honey potters , as it were , right ?
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape image , and the bottom part was manipulated .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-players .
players love to become part of the area of the planet &apos;s mission of awe .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly raining but they &apos;re indisgusting .
i was the second volunteer in the burn spot , so i had quite good chance to get there .
and the side side is what are the virizing hormones making .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
i felt like our send clocks and cameras were dreaming of them .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there probably wasn &apos;t a defeat in her treatment .
by shaking the silicon , and by the way , it can connect the characters ...
i spend most of my time working with people in study , prisons or death cells .
during the last three decades , the crime rate in america has declined immense .
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap as well as simulating .
but now there &apos;s a bold new solution to get us out of this miserable situation .
you need this lie to sustain a lifespan to sustain self-deception .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something along the way .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another until you get to your first million .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
now look at what happened that day , just when you watch activity that happens in the network .
you &apos;re an up-attribute ? are you something that brings blood into wobbles ?
for example , the most sophisticated version of this kind of communication is the human language .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosive curve .
it allows us to produce things with much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
add this buzzer to an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a noise machine .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill you with hope .
whether it &apos;s a recovery place of a mind or a lot of error , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibets if you haven &apos;t seen it at the bottom level .
and one reason is , this enormous heat pin warms is warmer greenland from the north .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;m going to show you where the dalmatiner is .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a wetlands .
the day before i was done , i called the head of public work for the company .
instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back in .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
but we know , when we talk about that , the social relationship is very , very sensitive .
virtuality suddenly has become stranger for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
and the child plays , after a memorial break , instead of a red flower before , a red flower .
within a year , you &apos;re going to launch a survey and then you start with the commercial fishing .
i myself learned it from cub scout magic of the path finder in the 1970s .
the brand i am is , i would say , neglect fly .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just manage them .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agrarian industrial model for the future .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not like it &apos;s on .
is this something that you can participate in , because you have a few minutes left on ?
but at the time , when multi-cellular organisms showed up , things started changing .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
we need digital security systems where a human machine service cannot respond fast enough .
and i think our current command philosophy of mind helps nobody .
four : malignant cartels . five speakers : dangerous cruise ships .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
but the end of the day , it was going to be that i took space scientists with us to the deep sea .
and the basic lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commitment sport .
there will be this little blood pressure device that you attach to an iphone or something like that .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else , but to process information within the organism .
that will be , i think , in the next decade or two , part of the national statistics .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building than they &apos;re worth building .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the field lows have written last year .
and the color notes and the claims may be reminded of &quot; avatar . &quot;
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
and not only that , we used our imagination to devastate this world in a thorough way .
but these articles were worried to me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i figured it out .
if paul talks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t say without armed watchmakers .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not damians special meat .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailletes to fit everything .
you &apos;ve probably heard of &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 starches , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
these are our master-players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
they help to digest food , and they protect them against certain diseases .
for us and it &apos;s a game fundamental for connecting relationships and care of tolerance .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types challenging social norms .
now you might think that the whole thing was going to collapse by categories , somebody like me would be really happy .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
while we are falling , i had this feeling of dying human being is not terrifying .
what would you do that you shoot up , because you think you were there forever ?
if dan was a brand , he would be probably a classic mercedes cabrio .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is mentioned so many times today .
you hear a lot of just about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone can deal with it , are two different things .
now this may sound absurd to you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
the categories need to say something to the selection , not to provide choice .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t normally happen that way .
it was about a method that parents can find out which are the right public schools for their children .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard of before will become global communication .
but before i get to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer the way they were .
the second largest attacker group we can observe today is not motivated by money .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
what about virtuality now that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
if you &apos;re off one of them , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the same way we saw it before .
imagine if you could just appear in different formats or sizes in different forms , in different resolution .
so i started thinking about what it is that we make these games master .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to reach for the needle .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
they do it because they can follow the dotted white line on the road a92 .
because the phosphorus is being given to the pigs about the solid ingredients of excrement .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever they are .
all these photos are being connected together , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and then , if you make good shots , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
the importance is that creativity that exists in the internet culture of techie and geeks .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , to perceive and push the idea of our environment .
and dr. p. was always very colorful to fly , and just like created for kids working .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , it has to be used to the art of film . &quot;
and if you have a hundred percent renewables , that &apos;s like an autarous system .
but the same thing we &apos;re working on right now is working to apply the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , easy , easy or wide ?
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer watson at risk ?
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it is that government is not the same as politics .
we &apos;re going to point out , for example , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna in common with chimpanzees .
this might be the origin of evolutionary origins of , &quot; it grabs it in the eggs . &quot;
we &apos;re working with universities in sub-saharan africa , and we &apos;re inviting them to learn social redesign .
so many people now have in the world , at least one hour per day with online games .
it creates a very strong picture in its head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
well , let &apos;s go to the end that we have to get to , and then let &apos;s talk about the intermediate step .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and i haven &apos;t had that experience despite that experience .
and the reality of that expression is that we all get , and moves , inspired , united .
climate change ticists : do you have one or two sentences for the one to maybe convince you ?
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electrical power are being built on the same basis in the world .
now for me and for the composers back then and what you might mean for him today .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re living in a very peaceful time of human history right now .
you have to go up and go to the fire , and this woman has to get some shoes . &quot;
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more seeing this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right to his mind , even a right to his mind of progress .
i worked with people with dwarf grew -- so people who were smaller than usual .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; is rooted in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their school tasks under the street .
it &apos;s become the largest , and one of the most important private birdstream reserves in all of europe .
and that &apos;s always a little intuitive for us humans when i have to think very little about it .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
it was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very much shaped by their world &apos;s experience .
this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t play with particles so often .
i even come to one of my favorite ones , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
of course , in holland , you understand it easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in a single wikipediasant .
if we can do that , then this database is going to become perhaps a new source of information .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically go forward , you get about six , the stable structures .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a shared language , or a basic posture , to build the right prototype .
perhaps that &apos;s exactly the sense of adversity , a sense of icons , a sense of our own power .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
and you &apos;re going to give them all nutrients that they just might want without effort on their own .
and it seemed to have something to have , with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they cost .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
they live in a world that has transolete information and communication , as no one could ever predict .
they found an article wrong with thought , they could detect the creator of this thought .
we made little pieces , made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
and when i come , with my little v w piesel and i &apos;m just imagining , this feeling comes up .
that was the movement . it was the rightedness . it was the business plan of agriculture .
and i noticed how much of these deep six distances similar to a space mission .
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a million chance .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because people are pushing to work very quickly .
so the performance of working with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams work .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
but danny , in the entire american desire , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
our language is inspiring the social changes that have been caused by a technological change in many cases .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the trash as it goes through the system .
iceberg is born as a limestone of a glacier or breaking out of ice caps .
and every time i interviewed someone , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ?
now that the movie , since sundance was doing film festival , we can look at that .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been holding with what we call the gigapix technology .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
so that , as citizens , you &apos;re able to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
because the soil is just going to die , the mosses will die , and the wind will , and the water will wash away the ground .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really produce drought shapes .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when they think about their lives .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
so the idea is that we actually involve people with things together , collectively .
well , there &apos;s an epiphany that &apos;s usually something that you find because you drop it somewhere .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determined what the goal is .
you can go and create your own museum online -- all these pictures , you can put your own collection out of it .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , i &apos;m treated as if i was refused to the outcome .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in circular rots .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a little bit of a future away .
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at the walt disney hall .
if anybody built a two-inch construction , they would have carried the price home .
and so they all wrote down all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
but not only that -- merging and connecting with that , you know , with the universe and other devices out there .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and adapt at the same time .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 pieces , as you know it from documentations .
the rotor is this moving part within the center , this black object that you see .
and yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the erects .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts with when the process is pushed out .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic outcome .
and every time it divided , they have found chemicals spread to the same amount .
and it &apos;s also important to me to create something that is indish , but is also very time-driven .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics became a simple material .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken by the mind . how can you be harmed ?
so , people who think of evolution as a gene that is changed at a moment have missed a lot of biology .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to be able to communicate into the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them to where we want to .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and drills are not a obstacle that we need to be able to convert to get better with our lives .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
but the challenge is to try and figure out which ones are and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the following .
please help us do that , and try to not just improve health , but take your hand .
imagine that artificial intelligence is available to every mobile phone owner .
as you can see , the lagoon of palms and some mangroves was being surrounded .
for example , here , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiew in ukraine .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we see , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
if you want to know how the sea level is flowing through the ice sheet , it &apos;s going to go to the sea .
maybe you can stand up for a second so you can pause with the two over the project .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some color pots out there , but i &apos;m going to get new ones .
well , i don &apos;t like that question because it &apos;s been the logic of our food system that &apos;s been deciding for the last 50 years .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles from the next ocean .
it &apos;s actually so firmly sitting in its place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we are and what we have to do .
so he says that this actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all that still in their hands can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
some of you may have heard that a couple of weeks ago i turned on an ad on ebay .
and i was tapped from one piece to another piece of puzzle , and the edges of the fittest weren &apos;t combined .
that , suddenly , i think , is becoming increasingly important to success , just the usability is going to be an application .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this away now .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite parts of this image until i really am at the cracks .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world that we &apos;ve seen to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , unless we say we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area as well .
and so it &apos;s also so strong inside us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the more opportunities they have , the more they put their whole money into purse market accounts .
today we want to talk about how video is viral , and then finally , why it &apos;s important .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
and here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population have lost their right to vote .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s worried about the details of how to do it .
i &apos;m unfortunate , but i &apos;m trying to get best best to learn from that to pass on to others .
now , a language is not just the full set of vocabulary or a series of grammains .
they can only be taken in relation to some other chemicals that denaturize the mao .
his uncle flew in the diaspora with her sacredness that brought people to nepal .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for aquatic conditions .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , and we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
it lives in the deep sea , about a mile and a half deep , almost to boiling water temperatures .
so if you want to have better , you have to cross here and hold your portion of the deal .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-lapse shot of what happened over the last 25 years .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i create with a simple equation program .
there &apos;s this contested thing like these genetically engineered plants on the apples .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the topic , which , of course , lies behind , is usability .
there &apos;s an extra mix of cradle-to-cradle versions where everybody can join .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example , which keeps filling the newspaper over and over again .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact , more important than anyone on the planet .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we make them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seven-team and prime minister at the same time .
and through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
then , one day , he came back from walking and he said , &quot; dad , my legs crypt . &quot;
i have to talk to the man on the street , who are like me , otto normal consumers .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
of the people who were standing there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people two and a half months .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that it &apos;s coming away from throwing away to biodiversity .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used very often recently is evolution itself .
the first example is predicts what many of you know and some of you , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
so just that kind of thing comes out of the words that we use over and over and over again in the language of political correctly speaking .
so these nuts have made more to survive , and they expand in scale .
but these concepts of cyberage , which bring us these possibilities back to our ability to rediscover our ability .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more of my personal cause to play it .
but there &apos;s no clues that we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they said they were doing this model properly .
this is like , if i said , your child , instead of five times .
the moment it was , it was like a filmmaker had a stage shift .
it turned out that it really meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with their movie . &quot;
and it &apos;s about solving a problem with a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first ones to be the fourth generation fuels , and in about 18 months .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , and we had the code for america program .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
so , we were able to connect the little digital jumphead to the rotor controller .
echinacea , a little antioxidantium that helps you jump .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with it , that they fake themselves .
when professors get curious , they often get tracked into such a research semester .
and what happened is the machine age , and the book happened , and it happened , and it &apos;s the photoolithic .
so , you need to have the learning process of music to be at least as long as it is for the spoken language .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together and correcting the mistakes .
we &apos;ve managed to get about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .

and then we screwed a d.v.d brenner apart , and we pulled the laser out , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
of course , chance with randomly elected instructions is very small that , by accident , they &apos;re going to be very numerous , so i don &apos;t think any of the instructions are actually going to do that .
that means , instead of remembering individually , we have standardized , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
and yet , burning coal is one of the main reasons global warming is the remarkable clean coal technology you see here that changes everything .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , which does as though the opposite of the first sentence already proven and predicted .
and by the way , we go around and circulate and mix up so much that they can no longer tell you that isolation is necessary for evolution to continue .
well , i hope you will agree that players are human resources that we can use in real life to work , and that games have a great meaning for change .
this is a people that &apos;s not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because the celestial scene is comparable to the forest that people depend .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we studied the deep sea .
we see many , many gigabytes on digital photos here , which you can seamlessly and continue to , and then you can rearrange , in any way .
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 variants on ayahuasca , which you all see at a great distance in the forest that seem like a kind of way to be our eyes .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , let as many people see it as possible .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the kind of thing you &apos;ve done in front of each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , i think they &apos;re not removed at all .
that our system also has a price increase , because we &apos;re not going to make 20 percent of this , and we &apos;re not going to go through a price increase in the other things .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and already , by building phosphorus mining , we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium into the environment than we &apos;ve used in all the nuclear facilities .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of civil honor rights will be as high as before the prescription of the election legal law .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and it knows it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build systems right .
and as far as isolation is , if we colonize as a species of distant planets , there will be isolation and the environment changes that evolution could naturally produce .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you think now , a director must also lead , a leader must be like a ship quality or something .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and it completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
now , please run all of these random instructions , run out of all the programs , and eventually selected those of my presentations are the closest to my presentations . &quot;
and so i sent her home , and i missed a voice in me that was trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so gender is really complicated ; internals are not just in the middle of the gender spectrum -- in a certain way , they can be spread across the range .
i think the remarkable thing about the story of the last few years , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world .
so if you take the system the way i was taught , and you cared out all the mis-behaved health experts , then nobody will end up with it .
and because they work much harder physically than us , and because they live only three to six months , they disagree with their weight , in energy consumption , a little three-billion people .
a lot of arguments against it . fisheries pollute the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
and from my point of view , the scientific method of trying things is to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements in humanity .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the venice beach , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a jar of marmelade , who they had six to choose than when they had 24 to choose .
if this device sequences a rwandan or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls for the health agency and prevents a pandemic before they outbreak .
these are two very different units , the inherent self , and the memories themselves , and the two is part of the intermediate sense of happiness .
but i think , in this frame , here and with intention of making a deception something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle go in there and go from stage .
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , born , holy , suspicious and wise , the dalai lama or yoda ?
and because the government ultimately exhausts its power from us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , is going to affect how this change happens .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people , especially if there were a lot of jews in proportion .
at this point , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can communicate very well .
what that means is that if you met someone , and you were telling them , oh , your father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spreads from rough , is sort of a grant before the bug is on the institution of government .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future , is the fact that we now have more power than individuals to address the big challenges of our planet .
we now have , from our discoveries from around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
they &apos;re staring at the horizon a million miles away , and all they see is fluid channels and these density , dark march .
and what happens is that , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , on climate .
but then another very interesting step in which things became completely different , and that is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities emerged from cells .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable talking to you about it .
basically , you get every round on every silicon random random letter , and as you try to form words , they &apos;re checked over a dictionary .
well , i phones with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a fair answer , until i finally telephone the conducting biologists .
if i tell you that someone has ordered their lives as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his life itself .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected links that we form are the real nutritional ground of creativity .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
and i &apos;ve worked with internal people a lot , whose gender is atypical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
we all had to do that when we were children read a book , we took the description of the autor and we injected it on our heads .
we came up with music . and a few days later , i got an email saying that nathaniel was interested in self-education .
and we &apos;re struggling to do the media campus , for example , to show virtual reality in our v.r. lab , and we can actually do it all the time .
i spoke loud : you &apos;re listening to thing , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because it makes as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about , when it was about explaining the absolutely insane mobility of the creative process .
so it &apos;s now . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever went -- 27 kilometers across the diameter .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be in the process of creating a new form of cambrian explosion , where there could be massive new species education based on this digital design .
the reason is that , in the past , everything was better than anything was worse than anything was worse was , it was possible for people to experience a pleasant surprise .
and i was negotiating with myself that if i doubled my efforts for perfection , and never again made a mistake that the voice could stumble .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed to take several months to plan it , find the different places for the puzzle .
but it also turns out that we use all this time to play , in fact , change what we can do as people .
i can make the sound that the stream has had on the modern wing , which is a barocky cembalo can &apos;t do .
even from german to english , it can require more knowledge , too , once you think about poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say , u.s. should spend 10 billion more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
this is ayahuasca , who many of you have heard about , the strongest psychoactive premise from the repertoire of the shame .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here that are zooming up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise .
you have to imagine that if you make something of the classic coupling , you need five hours to take and with this new kind of natural software , you just have an hour .
i &apos;m a wall animal . to work , i have to stand up and sweat every day , to be really awkward and torture me and really uncomfortable .
so , they invented , according to herodotus , the cube game and agreed a national strategy , and one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using nuclear emissions , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship &quot; as a movie movie , an epic movie , a passionate movie .
so , in discussions now , these insulanders are always trying to do , they &apos;re doing autark , they have their own little web , and that &apos;s what we have to do with our connection and nothing .
and so we decided to build in berlin a hall where we can sort of map the electrical relationship of the island to one to three very precise .
that is , the interpret has to translate this unprecedented fear of notebook into another , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal music language .
and this is not only since apple is an elementary economic factor , elementary success factor , if i just want to use technology to make people use .
a lot of journalists called me the question , &quot; what test are you going to do , telling us if caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge field of things , which is wrong .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play games together some kind of game to control their health better .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even negotiated with dr. p. as a five-year-old child , trying to stop these practices , naturally without success .
one of the areas that we see this as a beipiel , in our culture today , in the united states , are fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , electricity generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then we use 20 years .
and since there was no video games or this overwhelming with computer-generated movies or all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
as you knew in the village , as you know , who has what happens to whom and when , today , is that that going on through this extension of our own devices , through these mobile devices at a global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was acting like that , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
i got a ticket of ticket , because i didn &apos;t go on the bike lane , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive you all the time on the bike lane .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most experimental quantum physicists , who need a good proportion of logic to add the complex ideas together .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us a dream of , &quot; i have a dream of speech , &quot; a kind of solution .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
and of course , when we get there , it gets us for obesity , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and all the textile industry .
at every single step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we &apos;ve tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
unlike the unsolicited conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and archists have taken over our house .

over the last 100 years , average life expectancy has more than doubled that to inflation has increased average income in the world &apos;s population has tripled .
and something interesting happened , and that was what fascinated me to jacques cousteaus shows , was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of eliminating the dangers , the others are creating when they &apos;re laying fire .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in the mind of others .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for preserving the people we love to make fortune sleeps , but we also prepare them for getting good with it .
and it turns out that when you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justification used the word because , let &apos;s try and replace it by the word , although replacing it .
i love to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , and to wear , and also , in recent times , too , photographing and blogging .

and every year , we ask students to create companies , products and services that can be positive in a decade to live on people &apos;s lives .
a process that , as anyone knows , has ever tried to do something -- in other words , is actually everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always keep reasonably reasonable .
and our european connected network is basically just made up of large , big power plants , wherever the wave is going to be all the way around europe .
i think that in general , molecular biology is now , so generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count to synthetic biology and so on .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and drudding cooperation .
his job is to create conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe began -- up to 600 million times in a second .
that means we &apos;re just projing our vision before we see it , we &apos;re going to bring it back into our seal apparatus , to say , okay .
there are a number of people who have much more uh-oh moments than others , and among the worst , fresh bwl graduates are frozen .

finally , this older black man came with a very concerned face recruit in the courtroom , and she sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
it &apos;s how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so that they create a very satisfying experience .

a juveniler , if you make the full power of water , has enough pressure , so i think , 40 to six inches in the sea , is about up to the bottom .
the reason i felt worse was because of all these available possibilities , my expectations for what makes a good couple of jeans go up .
i sent some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to get namensrights to my tedtalk 2011 .
and maybe we can see violin as something natural , voice and useful and feel so uninsulated by their presence .
i say that i include my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears or comes out in my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie .
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working with uninterrupted for years , sometimes we &apos;ve been back two to three months in a row .
and now you can just do something yourself if you want to test something yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , practice that courage to lie .
remember , when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when it passed saturn , back to earth ?

i spend most of my time in social sponsors in social settlements and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every ad agency we talked to has recommended their clients to keep their fingers from leaving .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to get us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
well , in egypt , the insurgency in april 2011 plumped the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of actors .
so what these reactors were a problem is what we put in our filling , and therefore the volume is dramatically reduced during this process .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night -- we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never had before .
according to burrelle , the premiere was in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
yes , it &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal power plants because we don &apos;t , or we gather stores , because it doesn &apos;t work .

we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventors , the contributors , because this world where we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to be able to collect first data in june or july , and continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that they dig , without all the complex .
how do you increase happiness very differently depends on how you think and whether you think of the memories themselves , or whether you think of the life itself .

and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly your experience of your child &apos;s football game very different from it .
because , as i said in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to form really well .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what &apos;s taking care of you ? let people do what they want .
i came to the realization that i worked in a goal that was different from evolution &apos;s goal -- not necessarily conflicting , just differently .

they were nivellizing the playfield , and they decided that anatomically , the commons count , not the differences . and that was very radical .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , right ?
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the human genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pure , if you didn &apos;t believe from the very beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence have come from you .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
now to make this conversation make sense , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in the vodoun and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all of the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most feedback , or where i succeeded in the greatest success , are those , where i interacted with things directly .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the generation , because , all the time , if you imagine the production , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .

now , the most brainless epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this absurd struggle between the foreseeable genetic nutrients and the bio-elite .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , then all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and preferred by evolution .
this is the greatest time ever there was on this planet , no matter what scale you are doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .

two years later , i had service in the emergency ward ward in a local toronto local toronto , and i was looking at a 25 year-old man with a rich rub .
and the wind power plant or the solar system or whatever it is , usually a back-up system is a system , or rather , a system that can only store in small quantities here .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a reasonable energy supply , and i &apos;m also a cradle-to-cradle , grateful that they said they use solar energy .
don , i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for growing so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t pollution the environment . &quot;

it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that rivers today tend to lead to themselves , chemical pollutants , abundance of pest control .
what logic is this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one that we actually know about in the most unconscious way that it &apos;s valid to spread outside .
but more importantly , in this app , it represents a new generation that is packing government &apos;s problem -- not as the problem of a sale-needed institution , but as a problem of collective action .

i &apos;m going to go to my footage of these icebergs , like making portraits of my ancestors , conscious that they exist in these individual moments of this way , never again .
and maybe that change could happen because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened doors to me rather than meeting people who have limit me or wanted to impose an idea of me .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;m developing like boyboxes to send the genetic question to the next stage of the orbit to get yourself to the sea .
there &apos;s a research facility called geoengineering , which is about various techniques to delay warming , so that we would get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i can &apos;t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the latest advances in computer technology .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that you exclude , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives you chose .

if we could do very successfully with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we might probably reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now we &apos;re going to see a slope by 1.3 .
as we move our science forward and further , we &apos;re getting increasingly into a zone of discomfort where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve probably had are too simple .

if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimizing this process to make octan or to make new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology with a small team than the last 20 years of science .
now we can make it more specific , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a rice , and that stuff can help millions of people extend their lives .
i had to do this individual exercise seemed to be infinitely repeated with these thick , elastic bands -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle , and i hated these bars more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in tape tape , which is the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell are .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the do it yourself , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the permission -- his technology that says &quot; slingshot , &quot; which many of you may have heard about , it &apos;s the size of a fridge in the dorm room .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something my friends call &quot; infinite-computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow you to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolyths in a trancestate that acquired glowing coal without burning , an amazing illustration of the mind to affect the body in a state of replacing the extreme arousal .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©ju that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i bow around a corner , i always knew what would appear right in the light sphere of the vehicle , because i had run over the movie a monthly .
in this picture , i &apos;ve taken a bush as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the changes of the tree of life , all the specific specific ones that existed on the top of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it &apos;s demonstrated its environment fitness and strength .
and the o with this premise with this premise then , for example , brian degger in england tried to put together a minimum degor , then took a steam pressure cooker , a heating plate , and , yes , so suppenbreasts , and then grew bacteria .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website , the founder , and said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ve got to really meet now , we &apos;ve got to make a real meeting , and then have two events organized in london , one in two thousand , two thousand , and shortly on that in the u.s. , in san francisco . &quot;

this is , if you focus a laser beam on one in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or you move in the liquid , and then you move into that focus , so that &apos;s what you do , like a tractor beam beam , basically .
the neolithic revolution that brought us into agriculture , and we were at the moment of the semen of the seeds were undergoing the poetry of the shame through the prosa of priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and grant -- only found 10,000 years ago .

this is really working , this is done in the academic setting , and we thought , o.k , which we might get there , then we took a webcam that screwed up , that turns the lens off , you &apos;ve got a microscope that blows up about four times .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100million .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what does it mean is , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a life . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them leave behind no trace .

my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could take you a lot more about what you can perceive and tell the many other wonderful things you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the emphasis of our environment .

i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that mimic the problem of decision-making -- narrow -- get rid of the obsolete alternatives ; convertify it ; make it real ; categorize it ; let &apos;s better deal with more categories , less possibilities ; prepare for complexity .
in our desire to protect the people who are at our heart and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even to provide a forecast for quality of life that they expect , we have to adjust that we don &apos;t have to take the basic part of the fact that somebody is disabled .
and what we &apos;ve done was we &apos;ve actually used a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anonymously and aggregated information from this network that is actually collected from the operator to understand how the city works .
but we don &apos;t even want to say something like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of statement for so long , somehow we &apos;ve been able to understand the insight of so internal and collective accepting that creativity and suffering somehow belong together and that art -- ultimately , always leads to the soul .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of life of an unknown precedent -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who have been searching every day as they &apos;ve been , in the same bed for 20 years , telling each other the stories of their day and including , we still have three in the same bed .
whenever we think about innate and landscape , we either complain and we are covering the old framework of the wild that &apos;s very simplistic in its simplicity , or in other words , a racial thought , and they &apos;re more connected to nature than we are .

and if you were to choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about it in the sense of time , you get an answer . and if you think in the sense of memories , you might get a different answer .
and our goal was , we wanted to get renewables to 70s to 90s and then there is this rest left , the last 10 , 20 percent renewables , and that will be very , very expensive , and that won &apos;t work , too , that &apos;s what batteries do .
feeding grain on herbivores , pest control for monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and all the time the agricultural industry just wondered , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be already ? &quot;
and the problem , not only a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a problem , it can be a problem of simplifying , which is , you know , any problem , any question , and how do you make that different or how to do it better .
and wind and sun and the burden have simulated and come to the outcome , a very exciting conclusion that , in the end , you have to get out of the conventional system , which , in twenty-two years , takes a mid-stroke of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , about four cents an hour .
and he saw me one day at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tired and gnadenless -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful , young girl , you &apos;re going to shine one day .
but in fact , we see it increasingly , and more , that if you &apos;re willing to constrain , and the unimportant equalities are getting rid of , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales , there &apos;s a cost down , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in decision-making .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-africa there was no religious faith , of course , one and voodoo is just the remaining of these very profound religious thoughts that were coming through during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snakes at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government is at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we do together , that we can &apos;t do on ourselves . &quot;
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called the &quot; eat , pray , love memorial &quot; -- which , unlike all of my previous books , went out into the world for some reason and became a big mega-event , international pollinator thing .
but the process and the heavy climbing that surrounds it was lifted when it was taken out of the genius where it wasn &apos;t going to cause anything but anger and let him go back to where he came from , so he realized that there was no internal , torturing thing .
but in fact , it had been thought about this for a long time , but you could never really simulate whether it was going to work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right material approach , it looks like it works .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 brand partners who were willing to get into this control that wanted to do business with someone as remarkable and as i was going to persuaded to do , and that eventually enabled us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t usually have told -- stories that an advertisement would never ever support .
now , this may seem a little bit absent first , so i repeat it to make it work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
not by the latest mice and tractor invention , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chain acids , but by forests , not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
in my 20-year medical sensation and journalism , i created a personal medical study of medical errors and false treatments to learn everything i could for one of my first papers for the toronto star of mine , white coat , black art .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , when it comes to , doesn &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse meat and no more beef , i want to cover it , and i don &apos;t want to cover it , and i don &apos;t want to do it at all .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went out -- the stairs up , the tide , the &quot; real &quot; firemen , who were already past with the holes at that point , pretty much , pretty much , in the bedroom to get some shoes .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be dependent on the help of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships , who would support them in providing the charter for the legislation of this charter and the demonstration that everybody can trust that the charter is really being implemented .
this is what has got more artistic training , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists working with just having to deal with these technologies and to ask questions about , you know , there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
this may be a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect it , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up from them because they shy us , because everyone has significant problems .
in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and she didn &apos;t get the poem rolled through it and she gave it a difference . she said it would keep moving on land and -- as she said , &quot; search for another poet . &quot;
up-attributes are things that are playful , fresh , like the fresh prince , timely , degradingly , and depleted like erol flynn , and agile , profits , glorious , magical and mystical like gandalf .
and where you see how far we &apos;re away from what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , obviously , obviously , a program , to 20 , 40 people , you want to be here on climate tral , right ?
they &apos;re summizing the repulsive co2 , which is the temperature increase , and that &apos;s the temperature increasing has some very negative consequences , and effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirectly implications that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes , and so all of these systems collapse .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life &apos;s time , tom was the embodiment of the embodied modern artist who was trying to master this uncontrollable creative impulse that he lived in and to deal with them .
so where the founding fathers were extremely intended to figure out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we embed more mothers in this concept , we could take more of a concept of cheating , not just how to protect them , but how to care for each other .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gur huberman , i was camenica , wei jang , where we were trying to make decisions for the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 plans across the united states .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideal wealth that you bring new elements to play -- like the testicles -- and also how the testicles both require trust and promotes -- while at the same time making incredible fun .
the reason for that is , if i were to draw it on a normal curve , where , say , these are the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random mass of technology that i want to show with a graph , then the graph is albern .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we made a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite a lot of times in relation to how often i think of other vacations .
and maybe a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post-humans in the future , which i can think of as a science-fiction fan .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure about , they &apos;re not going to be scared , they &apos;re going to be scared , these elements , and they &apos;re willing to welcome , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive for themselves , and that &apos;s a skill move .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who is sexually attracted to other men who are punished with death unless he is willing to undergo a gender transformation in which case he can stay alive .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re going to be more trained by the khan-academy , and by having the ability to use 3d printers and infinite computing , and much more productive than they &apos;ve ever been .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t attract a line between male and soft , or between male and intersexuality and intersexuality and intersexuality , we &apos;re actually what we say , that separation line is natural .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , what &apos;s the virtual world that allows you to recombine with the real world , that is our affinity to virtualization , which is virtual as something ordinary , natural , is addressed again .
and by playing music and talking about music , this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , trained , trained musician in juilliard .
the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy these huge shelves full of mayonaise , mustard , essig and marmelade , but we can &apos;t actually draw the same and the boundaries and then actually choose something out of the fantastic offer .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethnosphere . ethnosphere can be defined as the total of all thoughts and dreams , myths of ideas , inspirments and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the ears of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the lost mind to the weight that we experience ?
the next week i did the ideas , and i learned for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you cannot talk to the colleagues about it .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , and it was just about she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen so she could catch it through her and stuck on the sheet .
and this curiosity also showed that i used to be , whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , traveled through the forests , gathered &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and ponds , bringing it home , looking at everything in the microscope .
in fact , i &apos;ve spent most of my career looking for terrible situations , and trying to study social assembly in a way that they are enthralling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes you entertainment and accessible to the audience .
but because there was only one company , an agency , ready to help us -- and it was just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go around the middle man and go straight to my team to companies .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 man who was born as a boy , when he was young , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , living as a man , and he had just figured out that he had sticks and bugs and a uterus .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a small fragment of a melody that , as it is often does , is very , very tangible to him , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s prayful . he &apos;s leans afterwards , but he can &apos;t touch them .
these older people are now coming to me and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re giving talks . they &apos;re saying to people that they should stop saying that we have to do it for the first time in our history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to rediscover what we are , people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of all people and gardens to be able to thrive into a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
so what you got was this : your name represents here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the topic is going to be , and which could ever fly around the ears after the content , especially if i leave your company for participation in dumb .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©toile at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in mailand -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d to use it as a impulse for the flyfire .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for a while , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it unless you look at it like me , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be true if somebody believes solid enough of it . &quot;
there are some mushroom projects that can do this at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but get it to 100 percent is going to be very difficult , and get a coordination for co2 storage is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the storage question .
and there was a time when there was only jeans of one species , and they bought them , and they were bad at doing so , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you had long enough pockets and often enough washes , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count it , one , two , three , but as a group .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adstrinous plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version , make it bigger than the sum of its parts ?
now , what this thing does is it captures the informed values of sensors -- so for example , printing sensors and vibrating sensors -- and it provides legitimacy code that runs even in attack , with folding data .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that one of the men gave me on the platform .
about an hour after she got home , after i finished her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistant brought her back to the emergency unit of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came to market was how to be the best choice choice , what david laibson did was very much co-designed , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
and then there &apos;s a reminder self , and the remembering self is the one that counts , and receives the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor speaks to by asking the question : &quot; how have you felt in the last time ? &quot;
this is like looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s freaking him down when he &apos;s done , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the burn snow when he &apos;s covered by a meter of snow .
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is half the energy cycle without co2 , that wish will be found .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
we followed geneaology back eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it a little bit , they admitted that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him still with the spear .
so the tedtalk was very simple in the form that a charter city is a place where the beginning of uninhabited country , a founding contract that determines the laws that govern there and the people have the opportunity to decide whether to live or not be under those rules .
the people back or the ones that later see it on video will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would -- look , there &apos;s a hole and there , if it were real , it would bloody . &quot;
as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s wasted in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and the following source of his own mind .
at this point , the patients come in . they can not only take control , be the captain on their own ship , but can also help us in health care of the challenges that we face , and the free health explosion , double demand , and so on .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about it , which is that at that time , small oil droplet around the blobs that contain different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years before , because this information had to be evolutionarily learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit processing structure , these things were not there yet .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reject ourselves , and we expect the government , reflects our values , and we have changed our needs , and then haven &apos;t much changed ?
and these sounds and these rhythms have shown the geology that the topography of a region , and that has also allowed , of course , to defragment these songs and put them together in a different way , to the left , to the right and to the outcome child .
and all this time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- equilibrium .
now , understand that this is not just called the people have to eat dog food when they retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investment boats of their employers .
i took them with and sheep access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on .
you do it for the task , for the will , for the challenge and the ocean , is the most challenging environment , which is there . you make it the exploration way , and because of the weird connection that comes out when a small group of people form a team .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of patient a by simply letting the tube go into it without too much to shake it .
and , again , looking out at it and looking at it all , i can maybe rearrange my course after i was a search past . here , i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; nepotistic , &apos; here to bing , or pivot here to live labs .
that , as a translator , you have to translate not just the word to the text into another language , but you also have to understand the deeper sense of words and wortzusmenhang so that there is a sensual translation , everybody who has to do it with foreign language .
so not only a farm that &apos;s feeding its animals , not just a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water processing plant , not just for these fish , but for you and me .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve done it a lot better than the patient a has been doing it , and you &apos;ve got a lot better off the memory of patient a , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about your experience .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in ligends of evolution . &quot;

what if you could change sperm and egg cells or fresh fertilization to give your children a better chance to live healthier -- eliminating diabetes , reducing your cromophility , reducing cancer ?
you know , the genocide , the physical extinctions of people are generally convicted , but the ethnocid , the destruction of people &apos;s lifestyle , is not only judged , but is celebrated in general , in a part of a development strategy .
there &apos;s , for example , the anecdote that the report of a capital so on that the capital has observed can &apos;t be used in this area for large fish proposal or fishing scientists usually not being valued because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
here you have this censorship between the unconscious and the conscious one that jumps right away without you able to do something about it , and the things you know that you look very different , designed to sound much better for you and others .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been deserving for decades and almost as many lives have required as the first world war .
because i think that interactive media is addressing archaic , cognitive models in us , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can recreate the actual history of interactive media .
tan le , anonymous footscray resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak to places she had never heard of , and in housing whose existence she could never have imagined .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle , tag the things that they were waiting away -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that they would throw away anyway .
so this whole discussion , like how is going to be going to be moving right now , energy turn , like that , on the island , we have , for example , five to 30 percent exclusive energy , so we &apos;re going to keep tilting the wind and the sun off .
i &apos;m more likely to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome violin , but that we &apos;re open to embrace them , to grab them on the shelf , to use a campuses , and maybe even dance with it .
and it turns out , under a 60,000 dollars per year income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a huge representative sample under 600,000 dollars per year &apos;s income .
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside , they can go back to cell losebase , then they can plant 100 50 trees with a baby in israel or tunisia .
we have this life-plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to handle , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to flick , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and it never did .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and spots , just to explore and to see , instantly , characterized by visibility and access to information , especially what business sprawables do -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
if i were to take this entry seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me as a person can &apos;t celebrate their lives in any way , but today i &apos;m going to celebrate for the odds and adventures i &apos;ve experienced .
so she runs to the house and she looks for the paper and the poem goes through it , and she grabs a pen just as she goes through it , and then -- she said -- she was like grabbing it with her other hand and getting it packed .

and in the background , i &apos;ve been working on natural user interface design in the next generation of human computing in which our relationship with human computer computers , or how our tools , or how computers , from the computer , are changing sucessive to digital assistants .
descendants of the ancient tyrannian civilization , which populated the caribbean coastal level of colombia , and as a result , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massively receding above the caribbean coastal level .
there are also things that are totally around the world , which are not even aware of , but most people , for example , washing enzymes that allow us to wash up with four degrees of water , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
they knew that every year about 75,000 honeyans left their country to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 most poorest catastrophe , they experienced that the winners went up by 87 percent -- a result of both the two who sold the sales and the reducing of the cost .

i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem in mind , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that available , if things are coming faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
to make these theories , let &apos;s remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely a very high-gradient sabotage , it has to be a very high-value goal , and very likely , it &apos;s iran , because most infections were reported there .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked to a few years ago that had brought some siamese twins to separate them , in part to make a name .

what you have to do there may seem simple , but that &apos;s not . you have to capture all the co2 that comes out of the stone after you &apos;re burning , you catch , you get cut under pressure and then you have to laugh somewhere and hope it &apos;s left there .
and as he was as taken by a miracle , he started playing his violin , some snippets of violin concert , and then asked me to end playing them : mendelet son , tschakowski , sibelius .
i committed to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get a machine in his house , and we &apos;re going to find a way that he can make his art again .
now i have to say , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s come to my increasingly doubt .
i &apos;m a historian , and in this case i study how people went around with anatomy -- that is , human body , animal body -- as they went around with body fluids , with body concepts , as they thought about bodies .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take mammography &apos;s evidence , &quot; or any cancer quacine salver who wants to treat his patients with caffe-runner .
so now , if i do this , the profilers in the crime site go , they go in , they collect some hairsamples , and then they do this technique , and then they can say , o.k , this hair belongs to this person , like this .
he had the dog and improvised a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a bad shot , put another dog on and off the ice shelves with the fecalian knife on the belt .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s dwarf or siamesian twins , be it intersexually -- is often adapted by surgeons to the norm , not because this would be benefits to their physical health .
so , what that means is , if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place that humans think about in evolution , and particularly how we &apos;re looking ahead into the next phase , i would say there are a number of possibilities .
so there are big pricing challenges here , and there are challenges in transmission , for example , if we say that the energy source outside the country is , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the technology , you also need to deal with the risk of energy from where the energy comes from .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact with no more increases in the cost of food or restriction of its availability is that if we see co2 as a output material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that go away .
i started working through scientific literature , about how these centrifuge are built in natory , and it turns out that they &apos;re structured in what we call cascades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuges .
now the fascinating thing is that the betakarboline that are contained in the liane are mao-inbitors of exactly the same way that are necessary to potentially potentially potence the tryptamins . so ask yourself .
this is a problem because warming is looking at the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , if you look at , is replaced by microbes to methane .
what we also found is that the goal of attacking was to slow and intact happen -- obviously in trying to despair waring engineers so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get there fast .
so maybe it &apos;s more clear about this technological change , because the fact that there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being in society can give something special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is our .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be able to become information technology , that makes moore &apos;s law a long jump , and the price performance quotient doubles every 12 to 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we became sort of aware of ourselves , o.k , we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re so familiar with the people who are chatting and so on .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in anatomy , that we &apos;re going to get to a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might fall apart ?
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to dismiss and use less , but on average , that number will rise every year and double more than doubling the number of services that are provided per person .
i graduated , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelorwork of michael burk , ann-kathrin crence , joris klause and jan-moritz garbage .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars on -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are literally getting materialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
heinrich , because he &apos;s supposed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s xy -- because you assume he &apos;s male , he can now be moved into what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seatbye jeans if there &apos;s only one way to buy , is that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything , but most we needed , we were hoping to be a mental orientation , the willingness to be in hopeless places and witnesses . &quot;
i met these guys from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allowed them to project a light on any surface they want , and then draw it on a laser pointer that only regimes the negative surface .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyrannei of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self as one that kind of tracks the life itself through experiences that the ecological self doesn &apos;t need .
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then i get to other people , and i hear all these things to do because i don &apos;t want to contend them with them , or frankly , they disappear .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; is everything from top to bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely verified with brands -- from the front page sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beef , bone marrow and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can slow the course of aids .
it &apos;s an image of the first radiation particle that would put the entire distance around the lhc , then it would be about to collide with a part of the lhc to let a rain of particles prashing the detector .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i was just starting with elementary school , and starting to build and shape my self-image outside my family surroundings , in terms of other children and in the rest of the world around me .
and they &apos;re also called there by my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment i need cardiological support or whatever , but also looking at the past .
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me has formed as a strong and powerful young girl , and i could imagine as a way of seeing myself as a nature of strong , powerful , powerful and atlethic human being .
and in that , what i did is i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i wrote my visitation card on a piece of dna , and i amplified it 10 ^ 22 times .
they then have been pouring out over a three-month period of time with an &quot; sufficient &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; and they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote one .
and the message is , we have to get on these rotating masses , if we kind of have to get our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to get to the end of it .
if a performer in spain has done something impossible , something magical : by doing allah , ol√© , ol√© , ol√© , allah , great , bravo unbelievable , it &apos;s : a flexing look at god .
it was the same way that a monkey , where adel , klerus and others said , you &apos;re actually insane when people start reading , then the afterwards want to talk , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and i &apos;ve been holding it to six and a half ninth , and then we &apos;ve become with friends , i &apos;ve become co-founder of the company solon , who then became one of the largest cell makers in the world .
it was worth me to include in the clean space for all this year , because , you know , the massstable difference between one individual atom and that piece of metal is about the difference between the piece of metal and you .
i fell in love with evolution &apos;s power , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in single organisms , each cell divides , all the genetic information from the cell is transformed into both death cells .
that means we feel as guilty about the earth that we say , there is no bio-building , there is no bioland , no natural system , and as they all say , that our own excrement is going back .
he told me , &quot; i had to tell your parents you were never going to walk , and you would never be as moving as other children or you could never have had an independent life , and they just punished me since then . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation around and turn the internet on its head , so that instead of just going from one to the other , we &apos;re starting to go from many things to many things , and by understanding patterns that otherwise would have remained hidden hidden ?
and i know definitely that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to kind of suck down this dark path of suspect -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told as a teenager that i wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of aggregated reaction .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the edge of an epic victory at any given time that we rather spend all of our time in these games .
later on the day , i was driving around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place so natural to be , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps shrinking the size of the bottom 48 states has shringed by 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black men are either in prison , or in prison , or in a condition of impension .
and it &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this high-technology that you &apos;re facing is actually going to get you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , our archaic roots .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that contain fif- to seventh letter , and we added them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to put them back together , up to 72,000 .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24th february , a delegation of about 30 starvation people went to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the business of the urban sector .
the last example i &apos;ve got time for today to show is a music sequencer for live performance that we &apos;ve recently developed and in the silicon as sound , like leadership , barrel and drums .
i &apos;ve always been able to griffle my synonym dictionary , but i &apos;ve been ready to deal with the process of texting , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been beating my life in what the word disabled really means .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , nothing and concluded that this was visitation maps of the devil , and they killed the five missionaries with the spear .
and when i stop in seating another halboval , we don &apos;t see just one more unit , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , one circle , another circle , another one .
do you not fear that you &apos;re going to go through your life &apos;s craft and never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a scrambling dreams of rogue -- your mouth fills with the bitter ash of failure ?
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up , because things should be more intuitive , more natural , user friendly , and that &apos;s where you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us people , which is natural , what is useless or intuitive .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are turning into our best version at any moment , at any moment , and are willing to help to solve the hard problem , just as long as we need to retry the failure .
and because i was born without legs , and my feet had been focused after them , and i only had a few toes on this other foot , and i had a few toes on it , and he was the bullshit , and this stranger had to translate the bad news .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured by our technology , not by the things we &apos;re developing , not by our intellect and minds .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to also close a and give the clue , but designers also have to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the baffin islands , when i went to the narwhal-jagd , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
i don &apos;t have to touch these things emotionally , because right around the corner , there &apos;s always another crazy , colorful , radiation outfit that &apos;s just waiting for me to have a little love in the heart and look for it .
now , deciding to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our silence -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem of our decision-making is also influenced by very consequence decisions .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work , because we &apos;re afraid of being really sackgassum , and it keeps millions of people from blooming up .
it has three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulated countries , is high . the question for sure that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human contribution that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t . those who cut sleep deficiency and they don &apos;t constraint with bad results and good results .
and of course , when is something intuitive , and how can i take influence as a gesture on it and make things according to how they &apos;re using a friendly , so potentially intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and easy to use .
but when i phones with him , and i asked him why he did these interventions -- they were highly risked surgeries -- his answer was that these children , would be very poor , and therefore he had to do it .
imagine you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with clogged heart disease vessels , and your home physician refers to a cardiologist whose average performance is at 200 .
both in my career at robin hood and my side profession as a volunteer fireman , i am witness of generosity and kindness at large scale , but i also see actions of love and mute of individuals .
so i started thinking like this , and so i think , for sure , in the last few months , working on the book that will soon seem -- when the dangerous , scary , deeply expected successor of my driving success .
they enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie today , that we use mris to lift the funerals of the brain to make advertising and movies .
of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery , the visualities , knee-articles from titan and artificial hip joints for aging bodies that allow people to really use all their possibilities and develop across the boundaries that have given them their natural destiny to not even speak of social networking platforms , people can give themselves a personal identity in their own way , and therefore navigate them to groups that they &apos;re looking for themselves .
disabled , adjective : &quot; curved , helpless , helpless , destroyed , destroyed , destroyed , mutilated , wounded , assigned , displaced , disconnected , disconnected , disconnected , disgusted , disgusted , disgusted , naked , handdicapt senil , aged from traffic , recovered , enhanced , enhanced , harmed , harmed , harmed , harmed , injured , useless and weak .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i think , defend the useless experiments of his teaching teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as to assume that our scientific ideas are ultimately valid , that there is no mysteries in nature that our triumphy are ubiquitous , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
and we &apos;re doing a series of trips in the ethnosphere where we take our audiences to places like such cultural wonder that they are blinded by the laws , and hopefully , one by one by one by which the other is the central epiphany of anthropology , assume that this world has deserved to exist in many different ways that we can find a chance of living in a truly multicultural pluralistic world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our common well-being .
one of them is prevalent by the great choice of different salad ressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what happened was this image-made alternative that led them to regret the choice , and that mountains might negatively impact on the satisfaction they made of their decision , even though it was a good choice .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re taken out suddenly one day and they &apos;re suddenly on the outside of their lives for the first time , at age 18 , and they &apos;re seeing a sunset . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun starts to ramp on the hangs of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they learned in abstract glory . and the priest comes back to me and says , &quot; look , it &apos;s really how i told you .
and i found that he &apos;d collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won a letter competition in second grade , whether i &apos;d been walking with the papers on the parade to hallozine , whether i &apos;d had my scholarship or a portable victim , and he &apos;d used these pieces to teach his students , medical students from the hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
and if you have people who are the most convinced that they have a soul , or you can also say , the belief that they have been brought out of the soul to life , then they think of it as if the soul is such a hostile framework about them , not out of matter , they themselves out of meat and blood , so to the earth , something of the most affordable , uncomposable , unimportant , dead .
as an informationist , inspired by the kind of interaction we were with real objects -- along with my expert patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started wondering , what if we were using computers , which , instead of a mouse time , that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat floor -- what if we could intervene with both hands and to attack data physically and to organize it like this ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this in a sense , my talk , and that is , in the sense that the properties and the capabilities that we &apos;ve made of , from the age of the voke , and which have gone a little bit of a disponent to us in the machine age , that , with what we call cyber age , can be activated again , and that we can be activated in this way about this complex , technological , new products , in fact , not really into the future , but actually come back to us back to our roots .
at this point , jafour has said to octavio , &quot; what if we take an uncanadian area of our country -- what if we just take you through a message -- part of the american embassy , part of the canadian bottleneck , and if people then want to work under the canadian rules , or the united states , can you work there , and can do everything you would normally have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
the young acolyths are separated from their families at age three and four , and in a shaky world of finstar , in stone huts at the bottom of the glacier for 18 years . two dreams of each nine years are intentionally elected to mimic the nine months of pregnancy they spent in their lap in lap of their lightweight , now they &apos;re spending metamorphorically in the lap of the great mother .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques dembois told of , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; every child knows god , not the god of names , not the god of the debodied , but the god who knows only four words , and he always repeats them , he just always says , come , dance with me . &quot;
when someone has gotten a little harder and merged all these sacred and shared who you are , then my photo is taken from the notre dame-cathedral with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this space , into these metaverse , taking photos of other people , and making some kind of overwhelming models of social experience using other providers .
a huge story of success , but again , we have the problem of growing businesses , and we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start small again and go back and dedicate ourselves to the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s what i think , and our behavior , again , is crazy , and that starts again , again , people say , what &apos;s the basket , all this is wrong , we &apos;re not talking about saving .
there &apos;s not much place for it in the malaria swamp of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , shaped a mysterious nimbus of the earth that is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist on itself because it &apos;s being embedded in human consciousness .
so that the system is evolving to create backups that can make it easier to make mistakes that make people inevitable and also enable them to create loving spaces where anyone who sees health care can actually address things that are likely to be considered potential mistakes , and that &apos;s even rewarded to people like me , who should make mistakes and be rewarded for the gradation of those rewards .
i even did a discussion with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who introduced the psychedelic ethirea to discovering the magical mushroom in mexico in the 300s , about it . i said that you couldn &apos;t put those tryptamins in as a hallucinatory gene , because the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience hallucination .
many of you will know the story , because from steves &apos; paper on this later , a book that was filmed again with robert downey junior , when steve lopez and jamie foxx was a nathaniel anthony ayers , who was a contractor who was studying at juilliard conservatory , and whose promising career was sent early on his paranode schizophrenia .
for example , women who were using the election right , the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical commonality is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a utero mother and ovaries as a difference is not significant enough that we should not have the voting right , the right to full citizenship , the right to own right , etc . &quot;
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign providers like gmail , because they know that they can give more trust than local services , and they &apos;re encrypted about whales , so that the local government cannot sniff around in their conversations .
and so i ended up in the people who were interested in space , and who were involved with nasa , and they were sitting in the nasa expertise council , planning real space missions , and they go to russia , going through the mission to go through the biomedical protocol , and they &apos;re all about to go and then going to the international space station and taking our 3d camera sheets .
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art. &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to anyone from rescue assistant to cheating cardiologists , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you what about your ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him the microphone .
when you go back to land and you say , &quot; we have to do it , the fiberglass , the sublimation , and the whole technology , the difficulty of human performance , when you work on the lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain to others . that &apos;s like policemen or soldiers who have done something together and know that you can never explain it .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing device , take your own personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at kathryn schultz &apos; book , which is about being wrong , because nothing else in this talk will make any sense for you .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research where he took a grownup cell , a fibroid blaster , and by manipulation of just four genes that inducted the cell to bring it back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially is able to become any cell in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the ones that are made for cars , computers , cell phones , pocket lights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy that &apos;s using the world , comparing all the batteries that we could now produce , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
now , let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multicellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that ultimately shape in the last 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedame , which was exclusively achieved in the computer with images of flickr , just give an notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re getting images of men in t-shirts and so on in the university site , and so on . each of these orange kegel represents a picture that was found to this model that was listening to .
we put the chromosome of a microspecies . we roughly said , these two are so far apart from each other like humans and mice , and we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome , and we decomposed it to destroying all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;ll estimate our very sophisticated graphics here .
if you said no , the vetoprinzip was a little bit apart , and i &apos;ve been trying to doubt for 10 years , whether i &apos;ve been doing my great engineering study maybe really sucking up a smiling thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues are always talking to him , you &apos;ve missed the money out of your window .
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient believes only enough , a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
i &apos;d like to show you , just a little bit , one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , photosynth-technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
margaret mead , who said great anthropologist before she died , is that as we move towards a thread , unstepped , generic view , we would not only see the entire range of human imagination reduced to a tight mindset , but that someday we woke up from a dream , and forgot that there were ever other possibilities .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems of investing in something that you only have later on -- and the investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the ipcc report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
i went back to lhasa with a young colleague 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china , across southern tibet to lhasa , and only when i went to lhasa and i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear : 6,000 sacred monuments that were turned into shoe and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered by the catherlands during the cultural revolution .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , let &apos;s move people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher than the victim knows when it is black . 22 times higher than when the degraded black is , and the sacrifice knows -- in the same states where earth is yellow people .
i had such an encounter recently when i met ruth stone &apos;s extraordinary american poet , who is now over 90 , but she was a poet for her entire life , and she told me that when she grew up working out in the local virginia in the field , and she said she could feel her and hear a poem about the landscape .
it means that a little child from the andotes growing up in believing that the mountain is an apu-mind that will determine his or her destiny will be a whole different person , and will have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little child from montana , growing up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be carried away .
my role is usually to explain to people how wonderful new technologies that are coming up will be , and i thought , being here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also trying to understand what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible jumps forward , which are so fast that we can barely keep up with us .
and that would be their answer to the stock villages lomborg argument that if you were to use all of that time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals of that , the poverty reduction , the reducing malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things we can do .
these people have come online , but they &apos;ve illiterated it by using trojans to clarify money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keyloggers who &apos;ve collected our credit card information on the keyboard , for example , while we &apos;re buying an infected computer online .
and they &apos;ve set two of them up and said , &quot; oh , that &apos;s easier and cheaper , &quot; and then they &apos;ve just got open source , free hardware , electronics , assembled this device , and now they &apos;ve got the power power to do it , and are now the cheapest provider of these devices around the world .
woman parks came back to montgomery , where she &apos;s carrying two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who &apos;d organized the montgomeries bush boycott -- an incredible african-american woman -- and virginia durr , who &apos;s a white man , clifford durr , dr. king &apos;s status .
this made me another person than my friends under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests were confirmed by hucuk and the bothered celestial mustaches and the cannibalic spirits living on the northwest of the world , spirits that would involve them at their hair initiation .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the draper prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists who developed independently the natural process of evolution to work faster and to promote the wanting proteins in a efficient way called frances arnold , direct evolution .
and just now , in addition to biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code that is not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
bruce brown , a famous designer at the brighton university , has gone so far as to say that this mass media , he means the book and the picture , so not the internet , the internet , etc . and so on , what we call mass media today , have fossilized that these mass media of our memories and have empowered our ability to virtualize .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let me buy -- the name rights on the talk you just see , who had no title or much content at that point , and didn &apos;t give me a lot of hints about what the topic was going to be .
this set of skills lives from the transition with the idea that success or happiness depends on trying to master a challenge without being shaped by the interconnected experience of it , as if my life would have succeeded , because i could avoid the possible fall of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people perceive me with my disability .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best protein folder in the world , this was not a fellow professor , not a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked on business tiday as a assistant at a rehab clinic , and at night , this was the best protein dentist in the world .
now , of course , this was just a simple trick from dr. p. so i did the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , which was to make sure that the richest five-year-old girl in the hospital hospital in the second floor , but he actually made me see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience .
as i &apos;ve been looking for models for this last year to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas than we can help to deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
so we have this kind of situation where , as our science continues , we have to admit to so much more that these categories that we thought were stable anatomic categories , which made very simple ingredients to create permanent identities , are much more embarrassing than we thought .
so i went home and ate my wife for dinner and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to control a laser , so that he could do something again , that would be great . &quot;
so , at the bottom here , you see the lab , in leadership strikes , so this is a garage that has been put in there , with all kinds of lab scaffolding that university has been doing , a group in paris that has been doing something , and it &apos;s pretty successful , and it &apos;s pretty interesting things , because i also want to cut a project short .
i recommend all of you to read steves &apos;s book or to watch the movie , so that not only do you understand the wonderful verbality that has come from these two men , but how music has helped make that connection , and how it was the instrument , after all , if this pun has allowed the game to get the mithalf , nathaniel away from the street .
and if i transfer that now , for example , in which i orient as a superview , selected as choice , informed in the trap , it comes big to me , i can look at it in detail , and i mean , transcend , i can throw it somewhere or buy somebody or buy it and so on .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i deal with vibrant skills , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never matched for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable trying to answer the questions of people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
in the early 800s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and filming the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalians and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make sure that zombies were safe .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times the energy as much as it is , say , a coal-fired molecule and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the country and the other things , almost in a league .
no biologist would say , for example , caring for example that 50 percent or more of all species are just about to die outside of the world , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic case in the field of biological diversity -- is not the same as the most optimistic case in which we know about cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting obvious obvious rules for everything that &apos;s called the nuclear . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve been here and i &apos;ve been struck the energy system and talked about how this fits to the energy agenda .
the computer vision algorithms have been put together to meet the real space where these images that have all been made near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies . they &apos;re seeing elements of stabilized slides or panoric imaging and all of these things have been synthesized in relation to each other .
and then , if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is slightly intuitive or not usable to use the i-pad in many areas or i-phone according to it , although it &apos;s already much more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions for someone who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- is not knowing somebody who &apos;s not well likely to get sick and therefore not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namely the patient .
so we did a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , and we did a study with people at ing -- employees all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed up their participation in their retirement plan .
so if i want to bring you one thing today , it &apos;s that the collection of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overlapping , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns are emerging , and we see trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , believed that it was literally alive in the walls of an artist -- sort of like dobby , the house elf -- coming out and the artist , in some way , would be invisible and the result of work .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of hot eat , pray , love taste , and i fell into one of these basic biases of doubt that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work , and you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s going to be the worst book ever written .
we also have one of these same aggregate in the same size that it stands there , put it in the hall , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall now it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery back there , here &apos;s the whole ridge that we simulate the net .
interesting historic footnote : when the ears were conquering south spain , they brought this practice . the excuse changed in the course of centuries of i.allah , allah , allah , allah to ol√© , ol√© , ol√© , who you still hear about sticky and flamenco-dances .
now , today , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s monitoring the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors that are going to pass information out of the car , and then you &apos;re processing it , and then you &apos;re using it to send these cars back and change things in real time , while information is collected .
i was afraid , not for me , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to his mind when i started talking about pitches and arpeggios and other exciting forms of the didactic self-pedagogics .
so , the fact is that in the 20th century , 300 years from now , you will remember not for your war or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were against and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is either actively accepted or passively accepted , so the problem is not the change .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to push the latte into things that visual effects and computer-generated effects throughout new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that had been made using cg , and the main characters should all be cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably one of the nice girls still , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that was looking for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve already started studying bottleneck building machines in carlsruh , technical high school , today i think , kit is a hundred hundred feet of seventh .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures that was reporting a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible chariot sound .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do that -- you &apos;ll see the people who call government for a lot of different problems , including that a thylacine is in your house .
you know , one of the great sensitivity of traveling and one of the joys about ethnographic research is to live with the people who remember the old days , and the past still feels in the wind , they flushed on the rains , they tasted into the bitter leaves of plants .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though this one is boomed on a vantage , and then you get caught and the best friend who presents you with it and gives you a terrible discussion , but when you end up with the bad conscience , and you vow you never make such a mistake again .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who has two reflections on two different surgeons , and you decide which one to vote , then the one who chooses the one who has less slight , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and at the same time remove the co2 , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it not having co2 emitting , i wish it almost that it did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
you know ? i think allowing a mere person to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the basking and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little too much responsibility to debris them to debrare a fragile human psyche .
the beauty of this is that , if you do this , you do agriculture , you make biogas , you do it on a hectare country with five thousand thousand dollars in favelas , you can grow a farmer about a thousand-thousand-hundred dollars , and you wait for it , chickens and pig and pig and vegetables and fish .
we &apos;re too astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we &apos;ve struggled progress in which we &apos;ve done more of these things than we &apos;ve now entered more frontiers .
so by comparing color , contrast and hellity to the rings , to the individual images , to the photographic men , like the depth , deposited colors and disturbs , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of planes .
if i was going to go into a room full of colleagues and ask for their immediate support and find out what i just told you , i would very much not reach the end of the second story before it really would really unpleasant you , somebody would intertably intertackle a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not submersible to the deforestation of the earth . these are dynamic people whose existence is being displaced by recognizable forces , which are exposed to their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s located in the process of being the immense deforestation of the homeland of penan , a nomadic people of south school , of sarawak , a people who lived out of a generation that has now been unleashed in the forest , and now being locked down to prostitution on the prostitution , where they can see that flower is , and that almost floating the flower flower with the flower , which seems to the thundersea , where the hoods are located , the hoods that are located in the forest , and where the hoods that they are located .
the oil spill is actually invented , but we have enough online content to make it realistic for you , and you actually live without oil without oil . so , if you sign yourself to the game , tell us where you live , and then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs you , what &apos;s not there &apos;s no food supply that &apos;s impacted , how transportation is impaired , whether schools are closed , whether there are the insurgency of the situation . and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it were real , and we ask them to put on photographs .
what ayahuasca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacology potential of this prepartisan , but its processing . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that &apos;s a series of betakarbines , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinating , and that climbing plant alone is sort of like a blue one across consciousness , but it &apos;s being built with the leaves of a family of coffee coffee sausage with the name of the psychotridis missile .
simply knowing that hunt hunters still travel beyond the milky way street , or the meaning of the myths of the elderly matter , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist still chasing the breath of the dharma , means to call the central openness of anthropology into memory , which is the idea that the world in which we live in is not in a very absolute sense , but as a model of reality , a series of certain possibilities that would successfully disconnect our ancestors , and they would effectively choose many generations from the generations .
how do i talk about the interconnectedness between women for three generations in 10 minutes , and how the amazing strength of this interconnectedness encountered in the life of a four-year-old girl , when she was removing over her little sister over 30 years ago , with her mother and her grandmother , five days and nights , sitting in a small boat in the chinese sea . a connection that hosted in this little girl &apos;s life and never touched more -- this little girl that now lives in san francisco and talks to you today ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo-akolyths in haiti , or the warrior in the caisut-desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the woods , or a carawanniture in the middle of the sahara . this is random to be the colleague that i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a yak-hirder on the depths of the qomolangma , everest , the mother of god .
