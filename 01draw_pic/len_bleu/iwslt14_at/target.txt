sound familiar ? right .
we can do that .
all that interests me .
lento , slow .
yes , hello .
that is doable .
that &apos;s the system .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
the farm &apos;s incredible .
can i be honest ?
and this was fascinating .
that &apos;s super important .
it &apos;s a crisis .
what would you say ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , that guy .
that &apos;s very good .
quite a few more .
he answers the door .
why not live longer ?
it has sensors .
here is the video .
they all matter .
explore .
thanks so much .
that was all .
totally inefficient .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
nothing will happen .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
i actually am .
tremendously exciting .
very different notion .
okay . thank you very much .
play &apos;s essential .
so meet al .
and they did .
thank you very much .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good job ! yeah !
yes , hello .
they have similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
yes , milliseconds .
the whole environmental discussion .
how engaged you are .
so this is a wish .
bg : thank you .
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because , you know something ?
how do we know that ?
so this is for real .
so where do we go ?
you can enter inside it .
i &apos;ve got a question .
this would have been fine .
so they know everything .
so how does it happen ?
they &apos;re using their hands .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
and i thought about that .
i don &apos;t believe that .
what will these people want ?
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
so let &apos;s have a look .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot;
so , you can do it .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
i was exposed to him .
let &apos;s call him don .
you could see manhattan .
it is generic .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
but you know what ?
so what happened here ?
centers were established .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
score them again .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
these guys make money .
so what happens here ?
and i was an artist .
not guilt management .
and it must go back .
we can do it differently .
what is the media today ?
fly away , cat .
this is the last one .
can we do this differently ?
and those days are gone .
yes , that &apos;s possible .
oh , my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re taking off .
go home to where ?
what does it mean ?
what does this mean ?
oh , my god !
we &apos;re losing them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help you .
it &apos;s a lot .
does that sound good ?
the sun is rising .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
a long time , yes .
that &apos;s your only chance .
yes , so to speak .
thank you . thank you .
which was awesome .
three times out of 10 .
this is stephen watt .
thank you very much , guys .
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s horrible .
you need time .
that was us .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
like twice over .
here it is .
it goes fast .
i don &apos;t know .
music as language .
that &apos;s wrong .
this is hard .
it &apos;s interesting .
... yet .
thank you .
nice one .
after one week .
from seattle ...
which is singing .
it is possible though .
that doesn &apos;t happen .
yes , hello .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
we were poor .
is that all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you guys .
this is not ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
60,000 .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
positively .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
ole !
maybe not .
thank you .
unique .
thanks .
fine .
terrible .
sustainable .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
just because of that .
just one single one ?
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s true .
is that something ?
yes , well ...
it &apos;s possible .
no kidding .
thank you .
wooo !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
really .
yeah .
okay .
thanks .
yeah .
creativity .
right ?
right ?
yes .
right ?
right ?
right ?
yes ?
right ?
whereas .
yes .
yes .
right ?
thank you .
why ?
awesome .
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
sort of .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
you see ?
you see ?
you see ?
have you ?
hello !
whoa !
here you have it again .
and what is that thing ?
this happened around christmas .
so what why hacking ?
so it &apos;s a circle .
does that make you curious ?
because you can train that .
and how did you feel ?
my wife told me it .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
like that , you know .
thank you for your attention .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
want to feed the world ?
who does the very best ?
same thing , only bigger .
and here is a surprise .
finally : epic meaning .
but the point is ...
very scary .
superior technology .
they called me .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
what what happened there ?
and then presented .
what happens is this .
so that &apos;s the good news .
this is really exciting .
how about fitness ?
these changes are coming .
one is south korea .
and that &apos;s nothing .
why should i worry ?
and the answer is yes .
you could have done better .
it just hadn &apos;t been invented .
and here &apos;s the thing .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
so let me remind you .
you know , is it rational ?
that &apos;s god , you know .
this is a game for outside .
for example perception in this context .
does anybody know what this is ?
pattern recognition should also work .
well , i was next .
i highlighted it here .
they then also say , why ?
that can &apos;t be a problem .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
they were seeing something magical .
and it was a huge success .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
but they do the job .
i sometimes push too hard .
first overtime , second .
you saw the big peak .
and then everybody moved down .
i was in awe .
so that started the journey .
but it was very sad .
and that worked pretty well .
that &apos;s very risky .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plus sign .
this picture &apos;s from there .
think about your own choices .
okay , there &apos;s some .
her mother raised her alone .
it connected those two people .
tell me about this world .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
why not think about it this way ?
you can see this at the bottom .
that &apos;s something we have to understand .
most people here have heard of them .
we need to get the message out .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
is it going to be my size ?
this guy &apos;s name is tempt .
what am i going to look at ?
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they sort of go like this .
is it something about the light ?
and i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the two-cent tour .
you can see the water coming .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
so what happened years afterward ?
who are these cousins ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
i want to ask a question .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
what is decisive , if i &apos;m right , then it &apos;s valid .
the soul is something mental , leibniz said .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
this is a chart of what it looked like .
so , i &apos;m going to wrap up now .
perhaps instead , of what &apos;s really going on .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
we were a group of twenty people .
and that means there are too many of us .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to have bones .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
conflict is the genesis of creation .
so , what do we have to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books , after all .
and this is felix , actually .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
he kept pacing back and forth .
we love technology . we love creativity .
it would be unconscionable .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
and it opens up a map .
but what are we doing with it ?
what is the soul ?
so i made one .
the first : cut .
after only one trip .
my hunches again .
what creates the illusion ?
and so i did .
very expensive real estate .
and i always have been .
does anyone see anything specific ?
give pee a chance .
but that &apos;s not protection .
thankfully , right ?
it was different in china .
you make comparisons .
yeah . all right .
what needed to be done ?
this is really cool . &quot;
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
and why is it true ?
i &apos;m totally with you .
yes , there it is .
he had had the experience .
this is an old study .
dk : 60,000 .
i don &apos;t think so .
some have come and gone .
aww , thank you .
will i like the color ?
it goes against justice .
thank you .
they actually hurt .
why do this ?
thanks for listening .
it won &apos;t .
i &apos;m surprised .
i swear .
it feels great .
i represent children .
here &apos;s another example .
i am a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
we made this game in 2007 .
there is no feed .
tremendously challenging .
and i understand that .
people were going crazy .
the data came back .
but it hadn &apos;t .
maybe 10 times more .
be a mentor .
thank you very much .
so here it is .
but it gets worse .
jk : both .
turn the camera off .
inventing his own narrative .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
crisis . death . disaster .
and many people forget this .
and i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he kept pointing here .
there were still fishes .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
privacy is implied .
now , what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be daunted .
here you see the city .
how do we humans actually function ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
but where are we of use ?
the work of the interpreter .
that &apos;s exemplary .
let &apos;s call him don too .
but what are your fish eating ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
what do you think happened then ?
his name is paul offit .
that does not hold for emotions .
it &apos;s not our problem .
good afternoon , everybody .
he liked it very much .
she did it in secret .
and it even got better .
an almost identical structure .
is that your opinion ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it keeps you fresh .
that is a fantastic question .
my name is amit .
keep going . have fun .
and the answer is no .
okay , a bit more .
there were remixes .
so let me recap .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
i will never forget it .
i never will forget it .
there are billions of them .
have you seen these guys ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
so here &apos;s another example .
or is it photography ?
he is my grandfather .
ohhhh .
and then it went international .
well she was back all right .
and i went back to work .
this is happening to us today .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to tell you why .
huh . hang on a moment .
why does this happen in the first place ?
and so , we need energy miracles .
one of two things is going to happen .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
they had to worry about being bombed .
but i carried on with my work .
there &apos;s nothing poisonous in it .
the first two theorems are logically correct .
let me give you an example .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
it &apos;s like learning to speak .
were you ever envious ?
something shoots through my head .
yes , here is the data .
and then we said , okay ,
so , i just started playing .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
so the correlation is low .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
what about longevity ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
the match begins -- silence .
and this video is real time .
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
because to me it means memory .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
all the adults knew the risks .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
it can know where we are .
why did i go into medicine ?
but it &apos;s not documented .
they sell certificates .
and there are several reasons for this .
we started this over 15 years ago .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
i think it &apos;s odious .
just be who you are .
another very exciting phenomenon .
next would be nuclear .
it sounds scary .
that &apos;s scary .
um , my brand ?
leave that up to us .
it &apos;s entirely insignificant .
zero emissions , you see ?
but we need this everywhere .
but totally effective , right ?
the reasons for writing it .
and i tried something interesting .
dark urine . dark .
what defines a story ?
i remember my first fire .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
what else is risky ?
we are a smaller brand .
thanks for you patience .
and the family gathered .
and his answer was yes .
talk about getting by with nothing .
do you want them distressed ?
the truth is more like this .
and that &apos;s just the beginning .
at least not to navigate .
otherwise you couldn &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we say sustainability in germany .
how and what did they feel ?
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
but the reality is far from it .
he only has use of his eyes .
i like really nice clothes .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
and apparently it was quite popular .
this is a photograph of the object .
and so we measured its motion .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
something stiffened inside me .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
and those are the neural structures .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
to the book and to the image .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
i am a redefined physician .
they had been pushed genetically .
privacy is not up for discussion .
lego made it accessible .
our magazines are read by millions .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
was a very a very fancy project .
i would like to prove that to you .
do we really want to go there ?
that image reminded me of something .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
we can win back our nutrients .
that &apos;s just about the minimum .
you can show that you were there .
if you think about it , right ?
that must be our difference in age .
and it still isn &apos;t an interpretation .
so the first step towards an interpretation .
do you know what envy is ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
how far would you get with that ?
music is medicine . music changes us .
thinking , you know , two percent .
so with that , i thank you .
you can go all the way through .
it turns out to be really difficult .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
these will be irresistible .
but what will come in the future ?
five million people use it every month .
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that can make a big difference .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
we certainly need one to succeed .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
i could draw . i could paint .
they flooded the canals .
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
she shares her experience with others .
my name is brian goldman .
he was actually collecting fish .
this was my first sunburn .
they were still kind of happy .
let &apos;s make it kogi . &quot;
everybody needs a fishbowl .
we are dependent on two countries .
and we absorb all of it .
so not like a detox .
if at the moment they &apos;re waste .
an autistic pupil .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
and here you have the graphic again .
and of course that &apos;s incredibly slow .
she was back and near death .
i almost never cook with it .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
this is a lot of volume .
what should our report card look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terrorist .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
the data says it all the time .
you have that much uncertainty .
they are building an epic story .
which one would you like the most ?
and that was 19 yeas ago .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
he showed it to javier .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
you have not changed the story .
it is a completely different notion .
okay , we can do that .
how many people would choose creativity ?
is it just imaginary ?
now how could this come about ?
play is not frivolous .
this data was not available before .
so you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
your plant can blow up .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s go .
so what happened on this day ?
this is not a finished story .
no had never been an option .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how could we help you ? &quot;
it &apos;s not moving like that .
so what was the next step ?
and this made me really sad .
it &apos;s not our burden .
and there &apos;s good news here .
now we talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
and i memorized everything .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
and then they execute on it .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
that &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
and she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and one time we caught a live one .
so that &apos;s reassuring , you know .
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
and you wouldn &apos;t be able to save energy .
and the form has something to do with it .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
slowly but surely , it lifted .
it will start to look more and more like you .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
so the white lines here are population .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
italy wins . yeah .
the whole building is made of water .
you can play with a different type .
and then some very funny things happened .
what other brands are like that ?
now this is one of the images .
and really you do the same thing .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we went and looked at a site .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
today , there are 2.3 million .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i mean , that was epic .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
but , but , you know what ?
i began to feel a bit better .
but there are two problems with that .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so there are too many of us .
every bit of waste is a nutrient .
we can apply these things to other examples .
and you &apos;ll have a problem right away .
four and a half thousand people live there .
because technologically it &apos;s just not possible .
he pointed at the algae .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we can support them in doing good .
but with the right design , please .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
over the hills and all that .
we were given very accurate data .
that will take place next april .
he shook his head , no .
it was really , really quite profound .
we talk about it ambivalently .
this is true . i believe this .
so , this is world without oil .
let me read you the entry .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
the captain waved me over .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
we can support them in doing good .
and women successfully argued that .
so let &apos;s start with sunday .
the roof also is covered with water .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
we talk about bold , fresh .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
jimmy kimmel actually .
even cats were watching this video .
i never knew him in real life .
i felt like anyone could do that .
i had written these crazy things .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s starting with sensing .
he turns off the engines .
... meaning not so optimistic .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i think this is really cool .
everybody applauded politely .
now we see the opposite effect .
he retreated into silence .
so i followed my hunches .
we worked well into each night .
so scott gets this call .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
they stopped us from being inspired .
i represent people on death row .
it might take a moment to load .
now look at this curve .
we go through initiation rites .
they &apos;re homelands of somebody .
these are cell phones of the future .
all of these are consuming questions .
it &apos;s about repowering america .
we need to go far , quickly .
that is exactly what you are doing .
from the modern to the computer society .
first you see from back to front .
a dalmatian , exactly .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
so humans can &apos;t be pigs .
and that was the onset of als .
not even the truth will set them free .
we have measles in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
dosage has something to do with this .
everybody would like to make people happier .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
that was the first upright primate .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
let me tell you a bit about it .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
so that was the reason for the project .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
tell me a little bit about that part .
you can be logical and intuitive .
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
someone made an old timey version .
i lived in parallel worlds .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
the shores are from a different location .
this is a modest little app .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
and just to say , what is information ?
something really weird is going on here .
you should ask for some of that .
what will these three billion people bring ?
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
and it was what i was feeling .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
it was not drowned yet .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
156 nations carry our television channel .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , that &apos;s way off .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
it &apos;s part of our life .
then i see the dalmatian .
what takes twenty-five milliseconds ?
that which i just presented to you .
it &apos;s a solemn part .
you put a box like this over there .
the chef had overcooked it .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is an ecological network .
how are you going to feed the world ?
also , these are intermittent sources .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
and even lomborg has changed .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s vanished .
what do you think happens next ?
say what you feel .
they speared each other .
here &apos;s the building working .
it &apos;s completely directed .
he died broken by history .
it will get to you .
you always lose rare animals .
we design unique elements into this .
that might sound unusual at first .
so two cycles are created .
especially if he &apos;s already dead .
so , please forgive me .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
they literally flipped the switch .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
there are . there always are .
the side product is clean water .
and this is about shifting baseline .
and i began giving her my rap .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
now we do the same with airplanes .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
and every morning i hop on it .
but it does require a lot of planning .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
defeat would have come too easily .
her father died soon after she was born .
the world today has 6.8 billion people .
for a year we were penniless .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
the bricks are color-coded .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
to what we &apos;re thinking from a northern perspective .
we can re-invent things all over again .
i founded an institute with this in mind .
that &apos;s how things of nature are imagined .
he &apos;ll automatically go to the right thought .
today they &apos;re called project executing organizations .
he &apos;s wasting his time on nonsense .
it &apos;s simple , that &apos;s what will happen .
he was over sixty at the time .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
it causes leukemia in children .
and it will sound completely different from before .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
i fell out of love with this fish .
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
one billion people will go hungry today .
and i see greg lemond now .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
architects and engineers , thankfully .
i &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
so , this crazy story might be true .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
and i had to get out of town .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
that was more for emphasis .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
but then you really want to go deep .
it &apos;s to supplement the experience .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
blissful productivity . i love it .
we have reached a kind of equipoise .
thanks . i haven &apos;t come to the best part .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
i don &apos;t know who recognises what .
with people , it is released in the urine .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
the result of that has been disastrous .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse .
and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
it &apos;s separating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
we &apos;re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage .
but there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
and moreover , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up .
this this hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that out loud .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise .
over here , these are the apsaras .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
i call this &quot; shiny tiger . &quot;
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
they even can bring with them some financing .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
oh , my god . oh , my god .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
and it just disturbed me so much .
and then my brother started staring at me .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
this is bjorn sundin .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
i was trying to preserve the body .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
now you see the dalmatian .
it &apos;s the so-called osit model .
protect the environment , consume less energy .
that proves it , doesn &apos;t it ?
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
we talk about drowning in data .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
and , finally , this storage problem .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
we vanquished it . puff .
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we object to genetically engineered food .
what ? that really flipped me out .
now let &apos;s take that a step further .
i wanted to restore health from disease .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
thursday : confidence is key .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
but then reality &apos;s always unpredictable .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
they need to tell me about my brand .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
the third technique : categorization .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
but so many over the years were helped .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
you can zoom around very simply .
now , that blew my mind .
if you burn natural gas , no .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
and let me begin with one example .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can see it as change .
raise your hands . let me see .
so just imagine that for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
second half . end of normal time .
that means something built in a city .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
just spread it as wide as possible .
you move around , you have fun .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
we think about energy scarcity .
i call it the rising billion .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
let me show you how they work .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
the official dogma of what ?
third : escalation of expectations .
their problem is that they have too little .
they laughed more than you guys are .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the machine below geneva .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
which is great , because we need that .
now i put a bass line in .
so that made sense , that was a match .
we need to go for more research funding .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
let me give you good close look at this .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
what we want to do is make the future .
we have been here for about 130,000 years .
this is about one percent of the total population .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
so again , that was a real good match .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and that &apos;s a multi-million dollar corporation .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
engines , gearshift -- four choices .
no one has to green-light your idea .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and let me show you a simple example .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
well i went into the courtroom .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
the three words are : do you remember ?
we still think it is pristine .
and i thought i could blend in .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
here &apos;s this couple on the hamptons .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
china can make up for that in one second .
everything that &apos;s inside can be utilized .
it &apos;s all compostable all of it .
and yes , i &apos;ll move on a slide .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
and in that time you can react differently .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
this is something that has to get to zero .
say , there are no predictors .
instruments have developed .
or take lipstick .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
i &apos;m the pet guy .
they actually make us worse off .
the flows have increased .
i &apos;m happy to be here .
imagine mozart being efficient .
so give me a hand here .
remember those nappies again ?
and that generally looks like this .
she kind of set us up .
if you burn coal , no .
monday : color is powerful .
we asked around and nobody knew .
my mother phoned minutes later .
can you play it in blue now ?
no , we define what &apos;s inside .
and there &apos;s one central point here .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
and the list can go on forever .
so these were my prime motives .
repower america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology itself .
it &apos;s called batting average .
so what are archaic models ?
here are two different jewelry displays .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you see the timeline on the top .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you , danny kahneman .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
a lot of my clients are very young .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
this was the sailfin grouper .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
his personal impressions of the waterlilies .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
so littlebits is open-source .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
this is an annual melting river .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
he will have to process that as the present .
i &apos;ll try to do that using an example .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
that &apos;s how people imagine the soul works .
you &apos;ll remember the rule of three from school .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
feasting ? i was totally confused .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
we don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
and , what &apos;s more , you &apos;ll now always see it .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; no . &quot;
and the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
in two hours it &apos;s biodegraded , wherever it is .
this is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
the first theorem is , klaus claims there is no soul .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
protect the environment , produce less rubbish .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
so , let me give you a little peek .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
but play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and anyway , italy won at the end .
and here you can see roberto dancing .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a moment .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i do get tired , as we all do .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
in other domains -- the world of communications .
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
this is one of them , part of one of them .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and there is this stunning silence .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
and to report back to my attending .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
the company headquarters are right here .
there are some that are much more spatial .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
yes , so , what is biohacking ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
and we can see that it can be done .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
of course not everything should be compostable .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
well , i think number one is curiosity .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
save those . kill off the rest .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
you probably saw it on the news .
and in this mind they had memory .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
and how does it look in there ?
in those countries where people have money .
so we can &apos;t bear these things .
they reversed the flow of water .
and so that got me very excited .
we don &apos;t companies patenting life .
how about living longer with good health ?
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i wear jeans almost all the time .
so to him , they were just blocks .
the only thing they had was their mind .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
these nappies are everywhere practically .
we have twenty percent in germany .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
there wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe .
amanda is wearing our elegs set .
both are viable ; both take off .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what is brand gerry ?
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
and they didn &apos;t have photolithography .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
it &apos;s about making a beneficial poop print .
and , being young , i said , expectation .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
beginners &apos; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
to form a phrase with one &apos;s own breath .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
he &apos;s only deceiving you and not himself .
because we can &apos;t live our lives without this lie .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
that really is very important , that we get there .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
... these dosages have something to do with it .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
this is not about how happily a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
i want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
here are the results we just obtained .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
the responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
this is a dead turtle .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
and actually i become a character in the book .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
they become rarer because we fish them .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but settling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
now he &apos;s brought a tractor into the scene .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
there are also technical cycles .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
the first on here is the classic , apple .
it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
you can see on the left side a small boat .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
i mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
well it was a friday , this is true .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
this is not a question between privacy against security .
and he whispered in my ear .
every footprint is disadvantageous there .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
you can have a succession of changes .
this is alfred gonzalez .
what do you do with certificates ?
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we had to take them out , which we did .
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
now i &apos;ll put some percussion in .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
picasso &apos;s answer , just wait and see .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
of course this lends itself to a smart grid .
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
you know , i was a real science geek .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grouped together .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
it was four and a half years ago in italy .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
and this is very important , what i &apos;m going to say .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
so not saving , abstaining from , avoiding .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
it &apos;s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern .
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
we don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language .
a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
let &apos;s take sneakers for example , right ?
these theorems are absolutely logical and correct .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
they don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it was summertime : i had shorts on .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
i no longer want to postpone anything in life .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
i made it and i set to work treating her .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
so we start with a windows dropper .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
there &apos;s no problem with overpopulation among trees .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
this is another look at the tree of life .
the first is that we will not evolve .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
he says , &quot; brace for impact . &quot;
and the third area speaks for itself really .
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
think about this : this attack is generic .
how much money does it take to do this ?
you look around at all these museums here .
you zoom in . you really go in .
here , let me give you an analogy .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
grants and sponsors were sought .
and we built an ipad application .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and these women would get together and just talk .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i can claim anything .
i can claim anything .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so please listen when music is played .
and that &apos;s kind of the message .
how many would opt for memory ?
imagine then just two other little changes .
this is an idea worth spreading .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
so go ahead and start inventing .
go bother leonard cohen . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
we can take a look at that now .
so ants weigh more than we do .
that it comes to the human from outside .
cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
because they have special skills of facilitation .
we called it digital water pavilion .
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
but what this image represents was the problem .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s there , and comes back again .
they had 348 different kinds of jam .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
and it &apos;s also deeply embedded in our lives .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
we &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
each society is characterised by one primary medium .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
but those are all the roads in the u.s .
how can i make something as user friendly as possible ?
and then it &apos;s less usable or user friendly .
it &apos;s a type of territorial behavior , right ?
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie .
we went back to the titanic wreck .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the world we now live in looks like this .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the bomb .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please blow up . &quot;
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
play is the glue that binds us together .
if you have something to give , give it now .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &apos;s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &apos;d like to briefly mention a project .
you do this and then you &apos;ll see the sentence , although i &apos;m with the fire brigade , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
and we &apos;ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity .
it is natanz , and it is only natanz .
i don &apos;t know if any of you know this image .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
but you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
but will we make the most of our playfulness ?
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
let &apos;s make a short provisional appraisal .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
emc presents : &quot; embrace transparency . &quot;
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
i learned that it all changes in an instant .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no tv .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
and that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
so that worked . so booya for scott .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and we say that word with such contempt .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
good , really good , maybe an all-star .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
you are virtualising the reality without a computer .
thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
and we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
then i would say , my warm condolences , you see ?
i have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
i can say , the german chancellor is a man .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
it &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; the starry night . &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
it &apos;s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
the dog ! i was stunned with jealousy .
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
it was , &quot; in perpetuity . forever . &quot;
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
when i say realism , i mean photo-realism .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
repower america . it &apos;s time to get real .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
that &apos;s a funny occurrence , you know .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
not a movie , not hd -- for real .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big placebo .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
but combined , they can create something like this .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
well diginotar is a c.a .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
she had irreversible brain damage .
we no longer produce .
i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and of course how design affects perception .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
he smiled and said , oh ?
you know , you can choose your list .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
it could happen in learning time scales .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
they put her on a ventilator .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
however there is a political battle in our country .
what happened is the the so-called machine age .
just like it used to happen in the village .
everything that &apos;s nice in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
i know what people think when they see this .
ok , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
but we know very little about where things go .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
the ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
the brochures still say it is untouched .
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
it &apos;s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
it is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
you end up in thabo mbeki south africa .
it &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
there &apos;s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
i know of some people who haven &apos;t registered .
one a baby needs about six-thousand nappies .
hey , puma , do you are you really serious ?
he only lived until the age of thirty-nine .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the eighties .
and then we tried out a whole load of simulations .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
in other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that &apos;s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and &quot; ole ! &quot; to you , nonetheless .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
here here it &apos;s more likely to turn into my glasses .
because we don &apos;t we no longer make things free of stuff .
in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
there &apos;s an economist named edward castronova .
so , i say : let the world-changing games begin .
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
france scores . italy scores .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
well , we presented this to mayor belloch .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
and no , this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
zidane , the headbutt in a moment .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
they &apos;re in the united states and europe and in japan .
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents .
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so that &apos;s occupythesec movement has done .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can twist that around .
i sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently .
that &apos;s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
i won &apos;t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
you &apos;ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
this is &quot; the starry night , &quot; i think , never seen like this before .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
there &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;
i &apos;ll be revealing what &apos;s inside of it in a moment .
a research semester on the topic natural user interface design .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
so , simple : you come to googleartproject.com .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
looks pretty much like old-style assembly language .
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
we think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
and other another example are the ambient , intelligent systems .
but our perception , how it deceives us too .
so you &apos;re helping out there , just ask the people .
i play to explain what these tones might have meant .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negotiating with the islanders .
&quot; 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
these things are logically correct .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
well there are opportunities all around us .
they did it by draining the land .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
so the device you see here didn &apos;t work .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be here .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
it was a store called draeger &apos;s .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry i have to keep this so short .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
a all the beautiful things in life are inefficient .
there &apos;s the a direct returning system for this .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and in berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
but for now i &apos;ll just keep up the suspense .
and it &apos;s the first question to ask is what is right .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
he &apos;ll be very happy because he &apos;s deceived you .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
there &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system sucks .
so i wear two hats in most of what i do .
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river .
i &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
there weren &apos;t christmas trees . we made it all .
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
and i started to think i should just dump this project .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &quot;
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
and also anything they would conjure up in their minds today .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &apos;s unfair .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
that &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
and the doc says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
only i think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
so the movie will be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
and i was like , &quot; hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
yeah , bryan , the judge has some magic power .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
that &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
a friend of mine did that -- richard bollingbroke .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropist .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
my male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
we &apos;ve also been taking littlebits to design schools .
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
i want to say just a word about salad dressing .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
you know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of eden .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub-choices of course .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
the fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
and i &apos;m bawling , i &apos;m crying , like a little kid .
and the more candidly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
+ that is they &apos;re all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
my great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland .
before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism .
and if i &apos;m right , then the chancellor is a man .
it &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in kentucky .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
and i saw mrs. drucker , and she was breathless .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
in holland we &apos;ve been working on this for over three years now .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re not talking about resource efficiency , but effectivity .
yes , that &apos;s what a what you see at the bottom is the load .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
it would be so energizing and so empowering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t settle .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
these these networks didn &apos;t really take form until two thousand eight .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
an anecdote you might know talks about this time .
there was the leopoldshafen nuclear research plant .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
societal decay . 65 dead .
new investments to create high-paying jobs .
and they did this using so-called lead maps .
so it &apos;s about effectivity , not efficiency .
well let me work up some blood for you .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
when you look at the people you deal with ..
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
and that &apos;s happened to me these last six months .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
he invited over to dinner the king of siam .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
and they are just the biohackers , individuals .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
so when klaus says , there is no soul .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
we &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
in my warped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
should i respond to this email ? should i draft this letter ? &quot;
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
a playful , mindful brand . what is your brand ?
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct .
so that &apos;s just one application among many that you can use .
that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
it &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those additions .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &apos;re living with .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re going to stick with it .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
he said , &quot; we farm extensively , not intensively .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
a piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
so now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
there &apos;s some magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
so the awards were like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
but where would be the nearest aed to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
they live lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
so the question is , how should we deal with nappies ?
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
and she asked him , so what are your hobbies ?
but of course it &apos;s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i &apos;d like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment .
i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
we &apos;re making androgen , and we &apos;re responding to androgens .
tempt &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
a young lad like that , he &apos;s not interested in putting out fires .
i &apos;m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
i don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare black-shouldered kite .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is what economists call a &quot; pareto-improving move . &quot;
we take the pictures of those mini-big bangs inside detectors .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation .
because it doesn &apos;t know which haystack it should go to first .
let &apos;s call him miguel -- actually his name is miguel .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
and as a general term , we can use the term intersex for this .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
this is an average-size greenlandic iceberg .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
so beyond simple play , littlebits are actually pretty powerful .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 .
and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
you don &apos;t recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language .
it is you can see that it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
why do i demand from my audience that they listen actively ?
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
as the one hat , i do history of anatomy .
it &apos;s both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials .
and you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science .
a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories .
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
you practically first learn to read before you speak an a word .
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suffered more ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
it &apos;s when italy won the soccer world cup .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
and now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
and you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t .
at the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
that &apos;s high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves .
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
so how do we operationalize the question of content of character ?
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome .
and that &apos;s that &apos;s the core concern of of biohackers .
but now it &apos;s not on the local level , but on the global level .
and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you .
interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music .
whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste .
and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked .
and then he said , well , i &apos;m with the fire brigade .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
if i &apos;m not right , then the chancellor is not a man .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the atlantic .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
mark , mark , come back .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
tsunami warning . cyber-attacks .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons .
this rule of three contains three theorems .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the official dogma of all western industrial societies .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &apos;t exist .
but if i would ask you , how is your wife ?
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
naturally it &apos;s from asia , in this case from japan .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period .
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .
so all of the green areas , these are your target-rich environments .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball ?
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
by the end of march the lhc will be intact again .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
that &apos;s the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have .
if , in fact , we couldn &apos;t absorb and release phosphorus .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
and that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
it &apos;s our new homeland . it &apos;s called nunavut .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you &apos;d still have emissions .
you learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in bach &apos;s time .
one day this mirror says , yes , there is someone fairer than you .
so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
and i love this : &quot; watson vanquishes human opponents . &quot;
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
these are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be evermore possible .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
the consequence of this is that we &apos;ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
so there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
he said , &quot; bezos , i need you to go into the house .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism .
and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
i &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , cum laude .
and when i listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
what were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ?
the loud and soft symbols , f and b , etcetera .
that the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
you can only be climate neutral if you don &apos;t exist , you see ?
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s archaic . how can that be ? &quot;
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
one big spoonful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll .
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
then i took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that .
then the next generation came , which is where we &apos;re still primarily at .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand a thing about classical music .
so that what they had only conjured up in their minds becomes listenable .
and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds .
we have thirty gigawatt of photo-voltaic power in germany .
that &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
i &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
or &quot; how was your trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a strep throat .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .
how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ?
so if you think about this practically , here &apos;s where we are .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs. drucker .
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion .
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
the constant flooding of music today is not very beneficial there .
i &apos;d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
we &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
so i can drill into what i &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pipeline !
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo &apos;s say it .
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; finfisher . &quot;
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
and it &apos;s also interesting that they &apos;re also represented in south-east-asia .
then i will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework .
he asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &quot;
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
they had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 &apos;s .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
vaclav havel , the great czech leader , talked about this .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
they &apos;re pre-engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly .
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
and unfortunately that didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow .
some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphorus problem .
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
as an interpreter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first .
if they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the argentinians .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
standing before him is a gorgeous , scantily clad showgirl .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
the ground stores over sixty percent of the planet &apos;s carbon .
from the age of feudalism to the to the machine age .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
superimposed on top of a nasa geospatial image .
people are always upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
there will be a whole load of resistance and arguments .
and that &apos;s the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft .
evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived .
if you put that down somewhere , it takes a while .
it does not have a tangible , material nature .
of those have you ever heard of overpopulation of trees ?
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
he &apos;s interested in setting fires .
century .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
you no longer need to make music yourself when you &apos;re bored .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they don &apos;t survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ?
and it &apos;s easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind .
i say , ulf , why do you need such a big car ?
all this influences me and influences my experience of the composition .
there &apos;s the opec , a a bunch of amateurs .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutrients .
many people use the word but don &apos;t know what it means in detail .
why do we no longer sing to get from a to b from above ?
there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
he types &quot; opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out .
anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
because the plant in frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus .
two equally large forces with opposite signsnatures will cancel each other out .
and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network .
i said , &quot; miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot;
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
but there &apos;s a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers .
nasa has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano .
there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
in order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
halftime , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
has everyone seen the movie &quot; the diving bell and the butterfly ? &quot;
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony , tempt , and his cause .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an etch a sketch .
which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it &apos;s a computer game .
this has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the internet .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
we have two beings , both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day .

it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
according to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that &apos;s different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ?
but with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .

and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .

we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environmentally aware .

it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m exuberant .
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminine about feminism . &quot;
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
you see the colosseum in the middle , the river tiber .

there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
went in , and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .

at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
if there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .

so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
when they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?

we can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
that number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .
and i get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;

it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
that makes the baby carbon-positive for its whole life , right from the beginning .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .

if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .

this is a highly useless categorization scheme .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .

i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .

and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually a very straightforward one .
that &apos;s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly .
namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way .
you can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like .
that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible .

the next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more .
we negotiated with investors , i looked for new shareholders .
he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song .

and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .

the gray boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .

and they found that the average ceo engaged in about 139 tasks in a week .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
this supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system , of course .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it bleeds it leads , &quot; is very true .
so this is a story of napoleon iii in the mid-1800s .

because he led you down a path he &apos;s not on himself .
and issue rogue certificates .
what &apos;s left is storytelling .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges .
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .

i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m adventurous .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .

and that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light .

the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energies .
they said , we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
and you say , &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot;

and don &apos;t use the german word for predictors , which would be prophet .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .

and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s moist , it &apos;s very cozy .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challenger brand .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of tenants .
we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...

so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot;

which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
in a nutshell , a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
that made the whole thing considerably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
we &apos;d only be able to float in the earth &apos;s seas as amorphous molluscs .
we &apos;re cheaper than the diesel system , if the price of diesel rises by five percent a year .
usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .

it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .

and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
when countries get together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the co2 .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com .
that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nicely nowadays ?
the spanish painter pablo picasso once painted a portrait of a woman .
i was imagining a &quot; march of the penguins &quot; thing , so i looked at miguel .
i asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
in terms of big-scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an enticing , intriguing and frightening possibility .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leathers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
and they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
it consists of twenty-six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil deposits .
oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
the gray boxes don &apos;t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
i brought along an example of the north american tribe of the nootka indians .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
the idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off .
we &apos;ve designed an ice cream wrapping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature .
now when i was a freshman in college , i took my first biology class .
and half of the wastewater problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
it &apos;s necessary to always use what you would call political correctness here .
we have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
making it differently or prettier doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s easier to use .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
unfortunately not the one on offenbach , but perhaps you can give the frankfurters a hand .
in high school , a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
so given a dozen news stories , we will preferentially look at the negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
this is called a law of design or gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception .
they will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building siftables .
i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
and so because of my interest in the in this technology , i went delved into it more .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space .
that &apos;s a whole series of things you &apos;re concerned with besides your existence as a designer .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
no , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
so for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
i thought &quot; turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; let &apos;s have an off-the-record conversation . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x174 .
and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
another example from a very different field . monet painted his waterlilies an infinite number of times .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
or , are we destined to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality .
now just to give you some perspective , i &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
a tv or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don &apos;t expend them .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run-of-the-mill electrochemical battery .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
bill gross has several companies , including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells .
intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
already in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
so through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-centigrade you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
and also , even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s curving upwards .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs. drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
in both cases , these are gross underestimates , because we really aren &apos;t ferreting out the problem as we should .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
we had the age of feudalism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so-called cyber age .
but that &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the european one .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
you see , there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
but , what makes voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
in in china a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable .
i was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in .
and the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone .
how do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- woof !
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
you need this lie to keep this sham , this self-deception , upright .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
and i thought , &quot; well that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
are you an up attribute ? are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north .
you &apos;ll never forget it again , because i &apos;m showing where the dalmatian is .
so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland .
the day before the event , i called the head of p.r. for the company .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
we can &apos;t just do that .
virtuality has suddenly become something alien to us
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s .
the brand that i am is , i would call it casual fly .
and they &apos;re designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily .
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
but at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
vicious cartels . announcer five : caustic cruise lines .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yorkers , i apologize .
think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
but these stories bothered me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t testify without armed guards .
this is really my flesh . this is not damian &apos;s special-grown flesh .
friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength , and plus-one intelligence .
these are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
they help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
for us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
in that case , what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
and after , as i reflected on that , i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
what would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
if dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
the categories need to say something to the chooser , not the choice-maker .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i assign 20 percent less work than i used to .
but how is it with with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway a92 .
because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky internet culture .
and i &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
and dr. p always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot;
and when you have one hundred percent renewable energies , then it &apos;s like a self-sufficient system .
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
and the shopkeeper said , &quot; do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm &apos;s watson ?
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
working with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
by the way , about one hundred gigawatts electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year .
what they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .
some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot;
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of europe . &quot;
and that &apos;s for us humans , something is intuitive when there &apos;s an as little as possible a need to think about it .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often .
i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we &apos;re about to see .
in holland it &apos;s easier to understand this , because holland built the country on flowers .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
there is an old african proverb that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
when i turn up in my little vw clunker and park next to it , i get this feeling .
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker . a little story .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
but danny , the whole american endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
well , since the film premiered at the sundance film festival , let &apos;s take a look .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies .
because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil .
they lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non-profit called robin hood .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doomed .
every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus , which should really be circulated .
and yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those documentaries .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
to these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
&quot; i know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
you have to be able to cater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
adversity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
and imagine if you would a.i. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
and the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
like here , we have mr. dimitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to .
sure , i will have thrown some colors away too , but i will have added new ones to take their place .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
that i can suddenly that the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but i &apos;m going to click this off right now .
i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
and that &apos;s why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
they can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the mao .
his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fibonacci sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
there are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields .
going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that &apos;s behind that is usability of course .
there &apos;s also an extra association , the cradle-to-cradle-institute , where everybody can get involved .
here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow-burner , close to hand .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
through my work i &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; dad , my legs are tingling . &quot;
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular joes .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
i &apos;m talking about the soul .
we know that something else is really true .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
that sounds very spacey and like science fiction , i know .
their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece .
there &apos;s only the second best option , which is the fire brigade .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
that &apos;s like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
turns out it really means , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control .
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re deceiving yourself .
when professors become curious , they are often shoved into a research semester .
then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photolithography .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
we &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
and it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
because it &apos;s in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
we made an application for layar , augmented reality , to find these aeds .
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,100 ?
it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , i must say .
and that sadness really framed in one thought , which is , i only wish for one thing .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
i &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e. coli .
which is great , because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
you can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
and that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wifi works .
we you wouldn &apos;t be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
it would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
the founding fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
so , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
we hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of blithering idiots .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
i &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
you &apos;ll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it &apos;s a matter of course that there are predictors , you can &apos;t prove that .
the human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
my heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me .
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
in offenbach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the harvesters &quot; by pieter bruegel at the met .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &apos;re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
because people often come and ask , can &apos;t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
that might sound mundane at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
overview : i &apos;m interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in .
we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here , and all the individual aggregates here .
there &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i incorporated it into a design workshop .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mash-up between scrabble and boggle .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot;
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides ?
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little strident .
dk : you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
we find men on the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
now mind you , i want to maintain some divisions , anatomically , in our culture .
another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
i have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
but we should just realize that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful one somewhere else .
that was the first real-time strategy game from the world of warcraft series . that was 16 years ago .
and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer , how they came together .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; no problem . we probably hit some birds . &quot;
the big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
i know they were racists , i know they were sexist , but they were great .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced .
i was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense .
i had very low -- i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
now i am also older than chopin when he wrote the piece at thirty-two .
then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what charles has written is not true .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
now i know it and project the fact that i &apos;m seeing a dalmatian to the front .
and if you put it exactly between two equally big haystacks , it will starve .
they brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
that means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
so , i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
i brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these archaic , cognitive models are being addressed again .
it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same wavelength .
and it &apos;s important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if i think i know them by heart .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &apos;s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance .
then that unpleasant feeling that it couldn &apos;t look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
it turns out , miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
and with &quot; the abyss , &quot; i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
i don &apos;t want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
you want boot cut , you want tapered , blah blah blah ... &quot; on and on he went .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s uncanny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
i ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a motion-activated confetti canon ball .
when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world .
it &apos;s the first biological rucksack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in berlin-adlershof .
if we had twenty percent in europe , we &apos;d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
henry can marry in every state a woman , but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
diginotar is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
that &apos;s why all western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn &apos;t manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain .
but usually i have an accessory , like sunglasses , or i like crystal and things like that too .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
we do need the market incentives -- co2 tax , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
it would be easy to just throw a litre of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ruined for years .
in the last twenty years alone , fifteen thousand tonnes of uranium was put onto our fields in germany .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the australian aboriginals .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attractive .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon you will .
you see , even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
that humans are supposed to have descended from apes and that , yes , there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes .
all of napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver utensils , napoleon himself with gold utensils .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no billboards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fliers , nothing .
we want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
but , ancient greece and ancient rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o.k. ?
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
and that scientifically speaking , that &apos;s not not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much is kissed away .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
so no more saving , abstaining from , avoiding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste .
i &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
these poor apsaras have been trapped inside indra &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book .
so some of what i &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body .
they came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; superstruct , &quot; and see .
you can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s nonsense , a plaything for kids , we calculated everything , it will never add up .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
and so these are all flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spatially in this way .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
visitors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet .

an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
well bill , i suspect i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
the wealthiest robber barons of the last century , the emperors on this planet , could have never dreamed of such luxuries .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
here in the bottom left there &apos;s a group in indonesia , house of natural fibers it &apos;s called , but they &apos;ve been around for quite some time .
if we turn off the diesel , then you will no longer have this rotating mass , which causes a certain amount of idleness in the network .
thank you . so to understand more about terrapower , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
just as an aside , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
disastrous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
every day you release + you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as aed4eu , which is what the product is called , but also aed4us .
i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
i &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
in the himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria , with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit .
so it &apos;s not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string .
and this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s also not impossible , and if you &apos;re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swear to god , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
and of course we hope that we &apos;ll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
once you &apos;ve selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition &apos;s creation .
and what happened is that we transferred the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
this is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , dna , fragments , so that you can make them visible .
based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which i &apos;d like to briefly describe .
opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific .
imagine him as the communists enter saigon , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the internet .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
this isn &apos;t about rice krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
and he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas .
and so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .
okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
he says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anatomy .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
now you &apos;ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc .
that &apos;s rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn &apos;t at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what &apos;s behind it .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington , delaware .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
and you also know how much hostility arises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this piece of truth .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means i &apos;m losing you .
and a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , ssl encrypted services , services like gmail .
triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
it has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it &apos;s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it -- it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
you probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty roses .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
she &apos;s one of the organizers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea -- bigger than downtown boston .
it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations .
these might be courier services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the aed that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
and hackerspaces , so computer hackerspaces , c-base in berlin was the first , in nineteen ninety-five .
and for me , the best contemporary example that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
and if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system , the cable &apos;s kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibration behavior , so to speak , in the network .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
when you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then tones come out , which , together , sound like music .

at the next regularly scheduled election , pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
he had xx chromosomes , and in the womb , his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a masculine hormonal environment .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be haunted by this song forever .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames .
back then , when arjuna , the great indian warrior prince , when he was thirsty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight .
here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
and yes , so you can see that it &apos;s a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organisations , who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already .

and their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
and that &apos;s , well that &apos;s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
clearly , patient b suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m outfit-obsessed .

they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .

over the course of this film , we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to lax , right now he &apos;s over ohio .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mrs. posten , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
what i want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
we &apos;ve made up a fake ad that &apos;s very high resolution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve embedded extra content .
but i had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when i was thirteen , and so i always attended his courses while i was at school .
so we &apos;re not battery manufacturers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two .
and none of these plots , and we &apos;ve built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years , none of these plots was every sabotaged .
through a process of refinement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
and that &apos;s when ms. carr leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
no , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire .
one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
it &apos;s necessary to have one &apos;s own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
and i simply assume that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electrochemical reservoirs in the whole world for the next thirty years .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
later i learned that at about this same time , javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras .
and yes , a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which i also was part of .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
it &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
they cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
we &apos;re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transferred in .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot;

now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp3 player , nose hair trimmer , and creme brulee torch .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .
because now you can implement a rule of three .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
and if that pans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
when i found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
if i invite you over for dinner and i say : yes , we &apos;re having a pill with offenbach taste and a glass of water to go with it .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
when proctor &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usability , so natural user interfaces .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .

because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as when you &apos;ve done it yourself or have seen it being done .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
now , i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the kama sutra .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
you know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the watson machine ?
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
by not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ; they blame themselves .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the roomwent switched on .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles .
they are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more , well , practical questions being asked .
that &apos;s a network from the usa , that &apos;s more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the lhc .
they call themselves the &quot; elder brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now i &apos;ve already given it away .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
instead of having to program , to wire , to solder , littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their pcs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
but , as we make it cheaper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with co2 .
so you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
but you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way .
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it .
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gamers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
and then you see that even something like demeter , the strictest organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one haystack bigger than the other , then he doesn &apos;t need any sense or anything else .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
it &apos;s called pivot , and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents .
in the description of my presentation , it is written that i , as an interpreter , see myself as a translator , in the english sense of the word .
and the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accordingly .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olympics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
this is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop .
and of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and so my recommendation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
we should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
it &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
so you &apos;re noticing a change is taking place , from a defensive attitude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renewable energies is right .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an obgyn , a paramedic is supposed to be ?
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
they look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes , also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
one should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
and if you want to exceed twenty , thirty percent renewable energies , you have to switch off diesel .
and then we took apart a dvd burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
and they will they have been increasingly overwritten during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
because we &apos;d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
and by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through the thing , rearranging it in any way we want .
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
and i was blown away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &apos;t break through to the other things .
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
in sending her home , i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could watch the tedtalk . &quot;
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda ?
and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
at this point and if you &apos;re laughing , you &apos;ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
at the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
and i said aloud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference .
and i &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speciation based on this digital design .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
but it &apos;s also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
i can make bach &apos;s tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to .
translating from german into english can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it &apos;s the translation of literature or even poetry .
bg : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you &apos;d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
i &apos;m a mule , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
so , according to herodotus , they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
so , the other grade is : are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
you know , i went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; romeo and juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
up till now the following is always argued in discussions , these islanders are becoming self-sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale .
this means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non-verbal musical language .
intuitive usability didn &apos;t start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when apple appeared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices usable for people .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &quot;
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
and , you know , i was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of cg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it &apos;s happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech .
jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
and if we manage to do it , we &apos;ll of course manage to do it for adidas , for nike , for hennes and mauritz and the whole textile industry .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
and an interesting thing happened : the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
here you have this little mechanism .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
i told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally .
and our european energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the axle always revolves around the whole of europe .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opossum in my trashcan . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
there , the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
when i think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
i was seventeen when i took part in a course of his and played the last of chopin &apos;s four ballads , one of his later works .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion i had in the last thirty years regarding photovoltaics .
a whipped cream dispenser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , i think about forty to sixty bar .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
i say i &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth , in 1990 after it just passed saturn ?
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
and a pleasure too , if you look at how people in italy throw out a can of coca-cola from their car window .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
and i was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .

so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .

i came to realize , as a physician , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
think about it , that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did 25 years ago .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that commonality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
believe it or not , there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .

they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?

if they become more intuitive and then i have to rough-handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive ergonomics , when is something really intuitive ?
of course designers don &apos;t only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive ergonomics , but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course .
and if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery ?

so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustrated , i think , a truth about the human character .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : the less we emit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .

now , the most mindless epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ...

so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to refute .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .

if we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- banksy , shepard fairey , kaws -- all of these guys will be there .
children , elderly people , all sorts of people go there to simply examine this in a different kind of way , they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory protocols .
tastemakers , creative participating communities , complete unexpectedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .

a project i set up myself with the hackteria network in switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical tweezers .

and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at walt disney concert hall or on skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .

and then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities -- that better memory .
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick methodologically .
i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a view port .

we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
so , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
there &apos;s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .

last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten , and what is instinctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .

especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses ?
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shortness of breath .

i approach photographing these icebergs as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geoengineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white 75-year-old corporate executive . &quot;
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
and as we get farther and farther with our science , we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had are probably overly simplistic .
it &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd-source all these aeds all around the world .
none of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a y chromosome .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest -- i call him yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
so pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanomaterials ; and a.i .
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
and so with this premises with this premises , brian degger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini-laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
a group from ankara , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain dna to people .
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
and that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with don &apos;t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutschmark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &apos;re then trapped in there , so it &apos;s basically like a tractor beam .
the neolithic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fault .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
that really works , it &apos;s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately .
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secondhand equipment on ebay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a paternity test , so dna fingerprinting in other words , at home again .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actuating our environment .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
you know , when michelangelo sculpted the moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shouted , &quot; perché non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
and then the renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
because we want this self-deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &apos;s unbearable for us .
i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
but we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
and our aim was , we wanted to reach seventy to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won &apos;t work either .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kwh after twenty years , you &apos;d arrive at about forty-four cents .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-saharan africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; eat , pray , love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
with its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking : don &apos;t say that there &apos;s now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because i want to cover that up and not confess to it .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
those are it has a more arty character , so it &apos;s many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well , all sorts of things .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like errol flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like gandalf .
and when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ?
if you sum up the co2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and when i think about that , i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vacations .
and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a neat thing to see .
we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
and they will get healthier by using the tricorder , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the khan academy , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
there are technical concepts such as <<unk>> augmented reality <<unk>> .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard-trained musician .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises , mustards , vinegars , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
and you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
and he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the étoile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for flyfire .
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these co2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue .
and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
when we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
and these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
and for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for bing , over here for live labs pivot .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can &apos;t just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remembering self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience .
the great 20th-century geneticist , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot;
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them .
what if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
i think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media .
tan le , anonymous footscray resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you &apos;ll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in israel or tunisia with one baby .
we have this bucket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &apos;t , all the fences i wanted to mend , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
this is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yoruba . let &apos;s make it cantonese .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant .
descendants of the ancient tairona civilization which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
that was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
in order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
i &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
and what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
i mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical &quot; 1776 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally forgettable .
what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know .
we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m italian originally , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you &apos;d have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher professor jürgen ude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in stuttgart .
but that &apos;s my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though , on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
we took a ps3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
we look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially recognised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again .
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o.k. -- centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
and since then , i &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the ctos of the fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
i committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &apos;m like , &quot; all right , here &apos;s the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
i &apos;m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of hhs who &apos;s saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , &quot; or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
so when i now that &apos;s what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s dwarfism , or it &apos;s conjoined twinning , or it &apos;s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . so you ask yourself a question .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
and then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said : okay
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor &apos;s projects by michael burk , ann-kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan-moritz müller .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , hd video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone .
henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the xy one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which mary does not need to worry about .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
i met these guys called grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
so what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
it &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc , colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support or something like it , but also looking backward .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
well , they took , over a three-month period , d-level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at a-level .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc .
in spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; allah , ole , ole , allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of god .
that was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &apos;ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course .
and then i stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then i became the co-founder of the company solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin-off q-cells .
it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
i became enamored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms , each cell simply divides , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
that means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no bioland , no nature-et-progrès or whatever they &apos;re all called , that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
later that day , i was driving around this property with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
immediately after that vote , on february 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
and if i then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot;
and now i &apos;ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and , because i was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &apos;d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so i thank you warmly for your attention and please .
this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of baffin island when i went narwhal hunting with some inuit people , and this man , olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
i don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very deadening , and it &apos;s preventing millions of people from prospering .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties .
in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but i &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
&quot; disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was michael faraday -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the girl scouts , you know , the halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it &apos;s called anima in latin , being like a breath of air .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie , and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
right , i &apos;d like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
at one point , javier said to octavio , &quot; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the u.s. embassy ; give some to the canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot;
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century persian poet named hafiz that my friend , jacques dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; : &quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me .
if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &apos;s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &apos;s this nonsense about , that won &apos;t work . i &apos;m talking about storage .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard evan shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 1930s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the founding fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
and i wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
when you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- i give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
a couple of years ago , the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
and , to dimensionalize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr . you just type notre dame into flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
if one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years , i i had grave doubts as to whether i was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father &apos;s colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child .
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah &apos;s original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the ipcc report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
i once travelled 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china overland through southeastern tibet to lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when i got to lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
it means that a young kid from the andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
and so , that would be your response to the bjorn lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
and they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they &apos;re now the they &apos;ve now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia durr , a white woman , whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr. king .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwhukw and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what frances arnold calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;
and so now you find it in biology , and i &apos;d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like a computer , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s material , i mean real material , and not just cybernetic .
and has nothing more to do with reality .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corporation , for-profit or non-profit , was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was a person from england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises i didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . &quot;
that here is biocurious , the hackerspace i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology .
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun -- in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
and if i now transfer this , if i let orient take shape as an overview , select as a selection , inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , transact means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping , etc . ,
the human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and i &apos;m going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
in the early &apos; 80s , i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength and tonton macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &apos;ll understand why ninety-nine percent of today &apos;s software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the ipad in many areas or the iphone , although it &apos;s already a lot more intuitive than classical software .
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing enrollment for their 401 plan .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
we also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here &apos;s the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network .
curious historical footnote -- when the moors invaded southern spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &quot; allah , allah , allah , &quot; to &quot; ole , ole , ole , &quot; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of cg effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg , and the main characters would all be in cg , and the world would be in cg .
i probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , i probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in karlsruhe in nineteen seventy nine , i think it &apos;s called kit today .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan -- a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea , where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real-time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis .
just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
and whether it is the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya , the curandero in the mountains of the andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
